C  THIS SUBROUTINE COMPUTES THE VALUE OF A GROWTH MODIFIER BASED
C  ON BAL. ORIGINALLY THIS WAS JUST PART OF THE LARGE TREE DIAMETER
C  GROWTH SEQUENCE. HOWEVER, THERE NEEDS TO BE A SIMILAR ACCOUNTING
C  OF STAND POSITION IN THE LARGE TREE AND SMALL TREE HEIGHT GROWTH
C  ESTIMATION SEQUENCE. THIS ROUTINE IS CALLED BY DGF, HTGF, AND
C  RGNTHW.
