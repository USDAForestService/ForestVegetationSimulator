C     COMING INTO ESSUBH, TRAGE IS THE AGE OF THE TREE AS SPECIFIED ON 
C     THE PLANT OR NATURAL KEYWORD.  LEAVING ESSUBH, TRAGE IS THE NUMBER 
C     BETWEEN PLANTING (OR NATURAL REGENERATION) AND THE END OF THE 
C     CYCLE.  AGE IS TREE AGE UP TO THE TIME REGENT WILL BEGIN GROWING 
C     THE TREE.
