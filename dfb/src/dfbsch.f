C  THIS SUBROUTINE IS CALLED TO SCHEDULE REGIONAL OUTBREAKS RANDOMLY.
C
C  THIS SUBROUTINE WAS COPIED FROM THE SUBROUTINE TMSCHD OF THE DFTM
C  MODEL AND MODIFIED FOR USE WITH THE DFB MODEL.  THE TMSCHD MODEL WAS
C  WRITTEN BY :   N.L. CROOKSTON   MAY 1978 & JUNE 1981   INT -- MOSCOW
C  THE CONCEPT FOR THE 'RANSCHED' OPTION IS FROM A. R. STAGE.
C  INT -- MOSCOW.
C
C  CALLED BY :
C     MAIN   [PROGNOSIS]
C
C  CALLS :
C     DFBRAN  (SUBROUTINE)  [DFB]
C     OPNEW   (SUBROUTINE)  [PROGNOSIS]
C
C  LOCAL VARIABLES :
C     I      - COUNTER TO LOOP THROUGH CYCLES.
C     I1     - POSITION IN IY ARRAY TO START THE SEARCH TO FIND THE
C              NEXT OUTBREAK YEAR.
C     IFINYR - FINAL YEAR OF SIMULATION.
C     INVYR  - THE INVENTORY YEAR.
C     IPREV  - THE DATE OF THE LAST RECORDED DFB REGIONAL OUTBREAK.
C     IYI    - CYCLE TO SCHEDULE REGIONAL OUTBREAK (SUBSCRIPT OF ARRAY
C              IY).
C     KODE   - ERROR CODE FROM OPTION PROCESSOR ROUTINE OPNEW.
C     NEXT   - THE YEAR OF THE NEXT OUTBREAK.
C     NYR    - COUNTER THAT KEEPS TRACK OF THE NUMBER OF CALLS TO THE
C              RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR BEFORE A NUMBER IS DRAWN THAT
C              FITS THE PROBABILITY OF A DFB EVENT.
C     PRMS   - HOLDS PARAMETERS FOR CALL TO OPTION PROCESSOR ROUTINE
C              OPNEW.
C     RAND   - A UNIFORM RANDOM NUMBER (0-1).

C REVISION HISTORY:
C   02-AUG-01 Lance R. David (FHTET)
C     (previous revision date was 01/17/96)
C     Added double precision variable TSEED to replace the addition statement
C     as the arugument in the call to DFBCSD because it caused a LF95 error.
