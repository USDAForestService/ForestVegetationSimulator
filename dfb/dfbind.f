C  THIS ROUTINE ASSIGNS A SIZE CLASS BETWEEN ONE AND TEN
C  TO A TREE DIAMETER BETWEEN 1.0 INCHES AND 20.0 INCHES.
C  IF THE TREE'S DBH IS LESS THAN 1.0 INCHES, THE TREE IS
C  ASSIGNED TO SIZE CLASS ONE.  IF THE TREES DBH IS GREATER
C  THAN 20.0 INCHES, THEN THE TREE IS ASSIGNED TO SIZE CLASS
C  TEN.

C  PARAMETERS:
C     DBH    - DBH OF TREE (INPUT).
C     SZNDX  - SIZE CLASS (OUTPUT).

C     CALCULATE THE INDEX.

C     TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EXTREME VALUES LESS THAN 1 OR
