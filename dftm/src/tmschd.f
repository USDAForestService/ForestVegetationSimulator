C     THIS ROUTINE IS CALLED ONCE PER SIMULATION FROM DFTMIN AND  
C     SCHEDULES ALL OF THE NECESSARY OUTBREAK BEGINNING CYCLES.   
C     IF 'RANSCHED' OPTION IS SPECIFIED, THIS ROUTINE ALSO SCHEDULES    
C     THE TIMING OF REGIONAL OUTBREAKS.

C     
C     THE CONCEPT FOR THE 'RANSCHED' OPTION IS FROM A. R.   
C     STAGE. INT -- MOSCOW.
