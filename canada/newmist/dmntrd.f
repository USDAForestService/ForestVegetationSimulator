C **DMNTRD -- NISI  Date of last revision: April 10 1994 
C----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Purpose:
C  Height and crown may change as each tree record is projected. In
C contrast, DM infections are fixed on the branches and do not move
C within the crown. This means that infection loads must be modified
C so that they accurately represent the relationship between
C nonmoving infections and moving crown third breakponts. In 
C particular, new and uninfected crown is produced at the top, and
C crown death may occur at the lower crown margin. By locating the
C change in breakpoints, the proper proportions of existing infection
C density can be properly reassigned.

C Local variable definitions:
C
C     INTEGER   i         Loop counter for crown thirds.
C     INTEGER   j         Loop counter for crown thirds.
C     INTEGER   k         Crown third in which breakpoint lies
C                          following growth.
C     INTEGER   u         Loop counter for treelist records.
C     INTEGER   v         Loop counter for life history pools
C     REAL      x         Sum of previous breakpoint values.
C     REAL      Wt        Scalar to assign correct proportion 
C                          of infection in old crown third across
C                          breakpoint now lying in that crown third.
C     REAL      Mult      Scalar to adjust infection density as a
C                          function of the change in crown height
C                          over the growth period. See additional 
C                          note in code below.
C     REAL      OldVal    Array of infection loads before growth, for
C                          and individual record. Array is
C                          dimensioned (1:CRTHRD) for each crown
C                          third, and (1:ACTIVE) for each life history
C                          pool.
C     REAL      NewVal    Array of infection loads after growth.
C                          Array is dimensioned like 'OldVal()'.

C 'MULT' IS A BIT OF A KLUDGE. ITS INTENT IS TO APPROXIMATE CROWN
C GROWTH, WHICH ENLARGES (MOST) CROWNS, BUT DOES NOT INCREASE THE
C NUMBER OF INFECTIONS. SINCE 'DMINF()' HOLDS A MEASURE OF INFECTION
C DENSITY, IT IS NECESSARY TO SCALE THIS DENSITY DOWN WHEN THE CROWN
C ENLARGES, SO THAT THE ABSOLUTE AMOUNT OF INFECTION WILL REMAIN
C CONSTANT. IT IS A KLUDGE BECAUSE TO DO IT MORE ACCURATELY WOULD
C REQUIRE KEEPING TRACK OF CROWN GEOMETRY DURING TWO TIME PERIODS,
C WHICH WOULD REQUIRE A *LOT* OF MEMORY.
