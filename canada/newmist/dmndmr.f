C Purpose:
C   The most common measure of infection status is Hawksworth's DMR.
C This routine transforms the projected infection levels from each
C crown third into the 0-6 Hawksworth scale. From the life history
C pools there are two components that contribute to the DMR: the
C ACTIVE (flower producing) and suprsd (formerly flower producing,
C now quiescent or suppressed). By this point, fecundity scalings
C (DMITUN, etc.) have already happened, and the pools represent DMR
C density for the crown the infection resdides in. A random process
C is used to determine what to do with the fractional parts of
C infection. For example, if the sum of the ACTIVE+SUPRSD pools is
C 1.71 in the lower crown third, there is a 71% chance of the crown
C third being given a 2 rating, and a 29% chance of being rated a 1.
C The crown thirds are then added up to give the tree rating.
