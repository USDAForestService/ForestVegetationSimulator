C----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Purpose:
C   Spread and intensification are modelled in an abstract way. Real
C world S&I is based on seeds being thrown, sticking, germinating,
C etc. This routine uses some rough guesses about the probability of
C some of these events, combined with guesses about seed production
C per female plant, and the relationship between DM rating and the
C density of plants required to achieve that rating. These *guesses*
C merely get the number of new infections in the ball park. Fine 
C tuning is based on user-supplied scaling terms applied through the
C DMSTUN, DMITUN and DMETUN keywords. Once the model is more
C mature, I hope that the terms put in those keywords are hardwired,
C so that they will behave sensibly with their default values of 1.0
C
C For the record, here are the guesses:
C
C  P(adhering successfully to a branch tip): 0.05
C  P(germinating):                           0.15
C  P(being female):                          0.5
C
C Other factors accounted for here are:
C  1/  actual seed production per plant:    10.    (a guess)
C  2/  plants/DMR/observed cubic meter       0.25  (a guess)
C  3/  cubic meters per cubic MESH        MESH**3
C  4/  weight of each observation            0.001 (1e3 trajectories)
