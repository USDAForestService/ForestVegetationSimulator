C----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Purpose:
C   Create a frequency distribution based upon the binomial family of
C distributions and the variance/mean ratio. This allows a wide range
C of dispersion, from binomial to poisson to negative binomial. The
C distributions are accurate until the mean and variance are both
C very small. This occurs in cases where the mean is less than about
C 0.1 trees/acre and the dispersion is less than 0.1 In these
C situations the distribution is biased so that both the variance and
C the mean are larger than requested. One solution to this would be
C to constrain the variance as the mean dropped, since it is arguably
C non-binomial when the mean is low.
C   The routine begins by creating cumulative distributions for
C sources around target in each quadrat ring. The answer is returned
C in an array containing the cumulative distribution for the number
C ofC trees in the ring. If densities higher than 10,000/acre occur,
C the length of the array will have to be enlarged or the method
C changed, because the range of (the upper tail of) the distribution
C will extend beyond the end of the array. If this occurs, those
C sample sizes will never be chosen.
C   The next step computes the distribution function for trees in an
C annulus formed by overlaying the inner circle over the outer
C circle. The annuli have certain properties: there is always at
C least one tree in the sample: the target tree itself, and; there
C are forbidden observations that result from prior observations in
C the inner circle. These two constraints require the distribution to
C be reweighted.The algorithm is a bit wasteful, since the
C distribution of the inner circle quadrat must always be
C recomputed on each pass. However, storage requirements get large
C any other way.
C
C PS: The name 'DMNB' is an artefact of the earlier method, in which
C only the Negative Binomial distribution was possible.

C     ** A NOTE ON 'NB()' **
C
C 'NB()' holds the probability of observing 'k' individuals at
C density 'mu' with variance 'var' Two vectors are generated: PRV is
C the vector of probabilities for the circle which is interior to the
C INNER radius of the annulus; CUR is the probability vector for the
C circle which is interior to the OUTER radius of the annulus. The
C expected number of trees 'mu' in each of the circles is given by
C the area 'CrArea()' multiplied by the total trees/acre density.
C The number of trees in the annulus (the non-intersection of the two
C circles) is given by the sum of products. For example, the
C likelihood of observing exactly 2 Source trees in the annulus is:
C
C    {P(0,i) * P(2,o)} + { P(1,i) * P(3,o) } + {P(2,i) * P(4,o) } + ...

C where 'i' indexes the inner circle and 'o' indexes the outer circle.

C Find the distribution for the inner and outer circles that define
C the ring quadrat. If RQ=1, then j=0 and the center quadrat is being
C done. In this case the inner ring is a point containing the target
C tree. The point has only 1 likelihood: P(1)= 1.0.
