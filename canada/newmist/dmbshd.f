C Purpose:
C   The source tree produces a field of trajectories emanating from
C the position of an infection. These trajectories are recorded 
C using a target tree reference frame in which the infection
C originates from (X,Z) cell (1,10). The X dimension increases going
C away from the tree and the Z dimension increases from the ground
C up. After adjusting for the different reference frame of the
C target, each MESH band of the  target exists in some position in
C the reference frame of the source. For example, this could be in
C (5,2), which would mean that a portion of the crown of the target
C is 5 MESH units lateral to the piece of source producing the
C infection, and 8 units below. The job of this routine is to provide
C a list of all the trajectories that pass through (5,2), and a
C record of what (X,Z) positions they passed through to get there.
C These allow the intensification, between-tree loss and spread to
C be computed. This is done by using the 'ShdPtr()' to see if any
C paths went through this (X,Z). If so, then the 'iCS()' matrix is 
C loaded all the path and path-weight information, to be used by the
C calling routine. The use of 0:28 in the 2nd position of the 'iCS()'
C matrix simply reflects an empirical determination of the longest
C path ever observed when MESH was 1 meter. Most are shorter, and
C since MESH is usually 2 meters, much shorter.

C Argument list definitions:
C      
C     INTEGER    iCS   (O)  The path information, consisting of a
C                            triply indexed array:
C                            Index 1: for each unique path.
C                            Index 2: for each gridcell that the
C                                      path passes through.
C                            Index 3: for the (X,Z) location of
C                                      each cell.
C     INTEGER    iz    (I)  The z-position (source tree's reference 
C                            frame) of the target crown.
C     INTEGER    ix    (I)  The x-position (etc.) of the target crown
C     INTEGER    ivLen (O)  The length of each path passing through
C                            (iz,ix); this corresponds to the relevant
C                            length of iCS(-,2,-)
C     INTEGER    ivCnt (O)  The number of paths passing through (iz,ix)
C                            This corresponds to the relevant length
C                            of iCS(1,-,-)

C      INTEGER   j          Loop counter for the length of each path
C      INTEGER   StrtVl     Pointer to position of first cell in path
C      INTEGER   EndVal     Pointer to position of last cell in path
