C----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Purpose:
C   Determine the sample size 'S' to be used, based on a random selection 
C from the cumulative distribution function. 'CNB()' is the cumulative
C density function for trees of all species. 'TotD' is the total density
C of all species in the stand. 'D' is the (autocorrelated) density within
C the ring.

C
C     REAL      TotD  (I) The total density (trees/acre) of all trees
C                          of all species.
C     REAL      D     (I) The adjusted density (trees/acre) for the 
C                          Species and DMR category from which a
C                          sample may be drawn.
C     REAL      CNB   (I) Array containing the cumulative
C                          distribution function describing the
C                          likelihood of drawing 'n' trees of any
C                          species or DMR category from within a
C                          sampling ring.
C     REAL      Prop  (I) Scalar the modifies the number drawn from
C                          the sample, depending on how much of the
C                          ring is in the stand.
C     INTEGER   S     (O) The sample size obtained from a random
C                          draw from within the appropriate species
C                          and DM class: the sample may be zero.

C Local variable definitions:
C
C     INTEGER   BigS      A random sample of the number of trees that
C                          are found in the sample ring. They may be
C                          of any species or DM class.
C     INTEGER   j         Loop counter for the cumulative 
C                          distribution.
C     SINGLE    RND       A unform random number.
C     SINGLE    x         The proportion of all trees that will be in
C                          the appropriate species and DM class for
C                          this sample.

C Draw a sample of trees, based on the cumulative distribution
C function that describes tree clumping. This larger sample is
C 'BigS'.

C From the larger sample representing all trees in the stand,
C determine how many will be of the required DMR, based on the ratio
C of the density of the appropriate tree class to the total tree
C density. This is stochastic: summed over all the DMR classes, the
C value of 'S' is not compelled to be 'BigS * D / TotD', but will
C tend to that value.
