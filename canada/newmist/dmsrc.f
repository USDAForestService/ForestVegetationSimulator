C  **DMSRC -- NISI  Date of last revision April 14 1994
C--------------------------------------------------------------------
C  Purpose:
C    The model requires the selection of source trees to surround
C each target. Further, it needs to select these trees from each DM
C category based on the DM category's density and the autocorellation
C that may be present. All these require a quick way to select these
C trees. This routine serves that purpose, returning three objects.
C The first, 'SPtr()', holds six array positions that are the break
C points between the DM categories. Within these breakpoint groups,
C 'SrcCD()' holds the cumulative distribution of treelist records
C within the DM category. This cumulative distribution can be used
C with a random number to select trees at random. Last, 'SrcI()' 
C holds the treelist record itself, allowing the unique attributes
C (e.g.: height, crown and DM rating) of an individual tree to be
C used. This routine may have the dubious distinction of having the
C highest comment/code ratio!

C Argument list definitions:                        
C
C     INTEGER Sp      (I) The species code being processed
C     REAL    D       (I) The density of each DM category of species
C                          'Sp'.
C     INTEGER Ptr     (I) Matrix of **pointers to treelist, sorted
C                          by species and DM class:
C                          Index 1: Species code.
C                          Index 2: DM rating.
C                          Index 3: FST is first position in 
C                                   'Index()'.
C                          array; LST is last position in array. This
C                          mapping is analagous to the 'IND1()' array
C                          of the base model, but with two levels of
C                          indirection.
C     INTEGER Index   (I) Array containing pointers to the treelist.
C                          It is sorted by species and DM rating and
C                          is an analogue of the 'IND1()' array of
C                          the base model.
C     REAL    P       (I) The density (trees/acre) of each record of
C                          the treelist.
C     INTEGER SrcI    (O) Pointer to the treelist index occupying
C                          corresponding to the cumulative
C                          probability within the 'SrcCD()' array.
C                          These records are sorted by DM category
C                          into groups marked by the 'Sptr()' array.
C     REAL    SrcCD   (O) The cumulative probability of each DM group
C                          is computed by taking the relative 
C                          density (trees/acre) of each treelist
C                          record and forming a cumulative
C                          distribution.
C     INTEGER Sptr    (O) Breakpoints demarcating the DM categories
C                          ordered within the 'SrcI() and 'SrcCD()'
C                          arrays. Each value marks the *last* entry
C                          in that category: e.g.: 'Sptr(3)' contains 
C                          the position of the last position with DM
C                          rating 3; 'Sptr(2)+1' contains the first.

C     REAL    x           Weighting term for each treelist record,
C                          based on total density (trees/acre) within
C                          each DM category.
