C Purpose:
C  The model frequently needs to access the treelist according to
C species and DM rating. This routine generates two objects: a triply
C indexed array, 'Ptr()', that holds references to the positions in 
C a second array, 'Index()', containing the relevant treelist
C records. A call to OPLIST generates the 'Index()' array.
C Subsequently, the key positions of 'Index()' are determined and
C stored in 'Ptr()'.

C     INTEGER Ptr     (O) Matrix of **pointers to treelist, sorted
C                          by species and DM class:
C                          Index 1: species code.
C                          Index 2: DM rating.
C                          Index 3: FST is first position in 'Index()'
C                                   array; LST is last position in
C                                   array. This mapping is analagous
C                                   to the 'IND1()' array of the base
C                                   model, but with two levels of
C                                   indirection.
C     INTEGER Index   (O) Array containing pointers to the treelist.
C                          It is sorted by species and DM rating and
C                          is an analogue of the 'IND1()' array of
C                          the base model.

C Local variable definitions:
C
C     INTEGER i           Loop counter for species and for walk 
C                          along 'Index()' array.
C     INTEGER j           Loop counter for DM rating.
C     INTEGER k           Loop counter for third index of 'Ptr()'
C                          and for position in 'Index()' array.
C     INTEGER Sp          Current species code.
C     INTEGER DMR         Current DM rating.
C     INTEGER PrSp        Previous species code.
C     INTEGER PrDMR       Previous DM rating.
