C--------------------------------------------------------------------
C Purpose:
C   To simulate spread the model places source trees in sampling
C rings around each target. This routine chooses those source trees,
C and is called once for each DM category. It makes its choices
C based on the number of trees it has been 'told' to find, choosing
C at random from the relevant DM category based on the density
C (trees/acre) of each treelist record. The attributes of those
C records are subsequently used to simulate the spatial relationships
C between sources and target.

C Argument list definitions:                        
C
C     INTEGER DMRCls  (I) The DM category from which trees will be
C                          chosen at random.
C     INTEGER n       (I) The number of trees to choose.
C     INTEGER SInd    (I) Pointer to the treelist index occupying
C                          corresponding to the cumulative
C                          probability within the 'SrcCD()' array.
C                          These records are sorted by DM category
C                          into groups marked by the 'Sptr()' array.
C     REAL    SCD     (I) The cumulative probability of each DM 
C                          group is computed by taking the relative 
C                          density (trees/acre) of each treelist
C                          record and forming a cumulative
C                          distribution.
C     INTEGER SPtr    (I) Breakpoints demarcating the DM categories
C                          ordered within the 'SInd() and 'SCD()'
C                          arrays. Each value marks the *last* entry
C                          in that category: eg: 'Sptr(3)' contains 
C                          the position of the last position with DM
C                          rating 3; 'Sptr(2)+1' contains the first. 
C     INTEGER SLst    (O) List of trees selected to occupy the
C                          sampling ring being processed.
C                          Index 1: The index value to the treelist
C                                   record.
C                          Index 2: The number of occurrences of the
C                                   record.

C Local variable definitions:
C
C     LOGICAL  flg        A flag that is .TRUE. whenever a treelist
C                          record has already been chosen; otherwise
C                          it is .FALSE.
C     INTEGER  i          Loop counter for the number of trees to 
C                          include in the sample 'n'.
C     INTEGER  j          Loop counter for the relevant portion of
C                          the 'SCD()' and 'SInd' arrays.
C     INTEGER  k          Loop counter for the number of unique
C                          treelist records already included.
C     INTEGER  m          An incremental counter that records the
C                          number of unique treelist records that
C                          have been selected.
C     INTEGER  pFrst      Position of first cumulative distribution
C                          and treelist record in 'SCD()' and 'SInd()'
C                          arrays.
C     INTEGER  pLast      Position of last (etc.) in arrays.
C     REAL     RND        A uniform {0,1} random number.
