C     PURPOSE:
C     TAKES TREELIST FILE UPPER CASE SPECIES CODE AS INPUT AND RETURNS
C     AN INTEGER INDEX TO THE SPECIES. NORMAL VALUES ARE IN THE 1-72
C     RANGE; NON-MATCHES ARE ASSIGNED 49.
C
C     THIS IS DUMMY CODE, SINCE THE SPECIES SHOWN HERE ARE ALL IDENTICAL
C     TO THOSE DECLARED AND INITIALIZED IN BLKDAT; THIS COULD BE USED
C     TO EXPAND THE ALPHA CODES THAT ARE RECOGNIZED
