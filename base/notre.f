C  THIS SUBROUTINE CALCULATES THE NUMBER OF TREES PER ACRE EACH
C  TREE RECORD REPRESENTS BASED ON THE INPUT SAMPLING DESIGN
C  FACTORS.  ON INPUT, THE TREE LIST IS SEPARATED INTO 2 GROUPS
C  DEPENDING ON WHETHER RECORDS ARE PROJECTABLE OR NOT. THE
C  FIRST IREC1 RECORDS IN THE LIST ARE PROJECTABLE. THE RECORDS
C  FROM (MAXTP1-IREC2) TO MAXTRE ARE NON-PROJECTABLE.

C       VP -- VARIABLE PLOT EXPANSION FACTOR.  IF BAF IS NEGATIVE,
C             VP IS SET TO ZERO, AND BAF IS ASSUMED TO BE THE
C             INVERSE OF THE AREA FOR THE FIXED PLOT ON WHICH LARGE
C             TREES WERE SAMPLED.
C       FP -- FIXED PLOT EXPANSION FACTOR FOR SMALL TREE SAMPLE.
C       FP2-- FIXED PLOT EXPANSION FACTOR FOR LARGE TREE SAMPLE, SET

C  MULTIPLY THE PROB OF MORTALITY TREES BY THE RATIO OF THE GROWTH
C  MEASUREMENT PERIOD LENGTH TO THE MORTALITY OBSERVATION PERIOD
C
C  THE INFLATION OF PROB FOR DEAD TREES IS DONE TO FACILITATE
C  CALIBRATION. DURING CALIBRATION THE RECENT DEAD TREES NEED
C  TO BE ADDED BACK INTO THE STAND TO GET THE CORRECT BACKDATED
C  DENSITY. THE CORRECT ADJUSTMENT IS THE CYCLE LENGTH DIVIDED
C  BY THE LENGTH OF THE MORTALITY OBSERVATION PERIOD. IT IS ASSUMED
C  THAT THE SAME PROPORTION OF TREES WILL DIE/YEAR IN THE CYCLE, AS
C  DIED/YEAR IN THE MORTALITY OBSERVATION PERIOD. THE PROB
C  VALUES ARE INFLATED FOR ALL DEAD TREES, BUT ONLY THE RECENT
C  DEAD TREES ARE USED FOR CALCULATING BACKDATED DENSITY. TREES
C  CLASSIFIED AS "OLDER DEAD" ARE IGNORED IN THIS PROCESS. HOWEVER,
C  WHEN IT COMES TO REPRESENTING THE TREES/ACRE FOR A RECORD IN THE
C  TREELIST, OR WHEN NEEDED IN OTHER CALCULATIONS, THIS INFLATION
C  SHOULD NOT BE DONE.  ANY TIME THESE RECORDS ARE USED FOR ANOTHER
C  PURPOSE DURING "CYCLE 0" PROCESING, THIS SCALING NEEDS TO BE
C  "UNDONE" (SEE CALL TO **FMSSEE** IN **CRATET**, AND PROB
C  DEFLATING IN **PRTRLS**, TO SEE HOW THIS IS DONE).
