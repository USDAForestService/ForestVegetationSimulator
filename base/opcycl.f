C     OPCYCL ESTABLISHES THE VALUES IN ARRAY IMGPTS SUCH THAT
C     IMGPTS(ICYC,1) POINTS TO THE POSITION IN IOPSRT WHICH
C     INTURN POINTS TO THE FIRST ACTIVITY TO BE
C     ACCOMPLISHED DURING CYCLE ICYC (IF NO ACTIVITIES, THE
C     VALUE WILL BE ZERO), AND IMGPTS(ICYC,2) POINTS TO THE LAST
C     VALUE IN IOPSRT WHICH POINTS TO ACTIVITY APPLICABLE TO
C     CYCLE ICYC.
