C     OPTION PROCESSING ROUTINE - NL CROOKSTON - JAN 2003 - MOSCOW
C
C     OPCACT IS USED TO STORE A STRING ASSOCIATED WITH THE MORE RECENTLY
C     STORED ACTIVITIY.  THIS ROUTINE MUST BE CALLED AFTER THE CALL THAT
C     ADDS AN ACTIVITY TO THE ACTIVITY LIST.  THE STRING IS ASSOCITED WITH
C     THE MOST RECENTLY ADDED ACTIVITY. ONLY CALL THIS ROUTINE IF THE
C     MOST RECENTLY ADDED ACTIVITY WAS SUCCESSFULLY ADDED.
C
C     KODE = THE RETURN CODE WHERE:
C            0   ALL WENT OK,
C            1   STRING COULD NOT BE ADDED BECAUSE STORAGE IS FULL.
C                A WARNING MESSAGE IS ISSUED VIA ERRGRO.
C     CSTR = THE STRING THAT IS BEING ADDED.
