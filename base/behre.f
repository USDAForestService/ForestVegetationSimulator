C  THIS FUNCTION CALCULATES THE VOLUME OF A SOLID OF REVOLUTION
C  DESCRIBED BY A BEHRE TAPER CURVE USING PARAMETERS 'AHAT' AND 'BHAT'.
C  THE LIMITS OF INTEGRATION ARE 'L1' AND 'L2'.
C
C  IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE VOLUME CALCULATED IS OFF BY A FACTOR
C  OF PI/(A CUBED) - THIS VALUE WOULD CANCEL OUT IN THE RATIOS OF
C  BEHRE VOLUMES USED IN CALLING ROUTINE 'VOLS'.
