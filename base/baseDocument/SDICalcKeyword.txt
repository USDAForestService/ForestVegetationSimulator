SDICalc Keyword

These are the field definitions.

F1 = Diameter break for the Stage SDI method (tree will be included if D >= F1 value), default=0.
F2 = Diameter break for the Zeide SDI method (tree will be included if D >= F2 value), default=0.
F3 = SDI method ( F3>= 1 Zeide, F3 <1 Stage), default=Stage

In the SN variant, the effects of selecting the Zeide method with the SDICalc keyword: 

1) the density-based mortality is calculated based on Zeide SDI rather than Stage SDI. 
2) Zeide SDI will be used to calculate the number of trees when stand SDIMAX needs to be reset at the beginning of the simulation
3) Zeide SDI will be used as the SDI target in SDI-based thinnings
4) Zeide SDI will be reported in the Summary Statistic Table

If a minimum diameter is specified, all SDI calculations are affected.
