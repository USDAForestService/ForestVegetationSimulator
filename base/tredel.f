C
C     DELETES TREE RECORDS BY MOVING TREES FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST
C     TO FILL IN EMPTY TREE RECORD LOCATIONS AT THE TOP OF THE LIST.
C     VACANT RECORDS ARE LABELED BY THE CALLING ROUTINE BY SETTING
C     THE SIGN OF CORRESPONDING MEMBERS OF INDEX NEGATIVE.  THE VALUE
C     OF IVACT IS PASSED IN AS THE NUMBER OF NEGATIVE MEMBERS OF INDEX.
C
C     **** MODIFICATION:  IF ITRN-IVAC IS EQUAL TO 1 WHEN THIS ROUTINE
C     IS CALLED, THE TREE RECORD IS DUPLICATED AND THE PROB IS SPLIT
C     BETWEEN EACH DUP.  NL CROOKSTON, APRIL 1985.
C
C     **** MODIFICATION: RECORDS BEING DELETED ARE MOVED TO THE BOTTOM
C     OF THE ARRAYS RATHER THAN BEING DISCARDED. THIS MAKES THE VALUES
C     AVAILABLE FOR FURTHER CALCULATIONS (SUCH AS SPMCDBH ON CUT TREES).
