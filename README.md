<h1>What is FVS?</h1>
<p>The Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) is a family of individual-tree, distance-independent, forest growth simulation models.  If is a system of highly integrated analytical tools that is based upon a body of scientific research and experience.  Since the development of the first model for northern Idaho in 1973, FVS has evolved into a collection of 'variants' which represent different geographic areas across the county.  FVS can simulate a wide range of silvicultural treatments for most major forest tree species, forest types, and stand conditions.</p>
<p>The FVS Staff of the <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/forestmanagement/aboutus/fmsc.shtml">Forest Management Service Center FMSC</a> in Fort Collins, Colorado, maintains, supports, develops and provides training for FVS.</p>
<p>Detailed information such as our workflow policies, and directions on building FVS in various environments can be found on our <a href="https://github.com/USDAForestService/ForestVegetationSimulator/wiki">Wiki</a>.</p>
