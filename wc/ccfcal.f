C  THIS ROUTINE COMPUTES CROWN WIDTH AND CCF FOR INDIVIDUAL TREES.
C  CALLED FROM DENSE, PRTRLS, SSTAGE, AND CVCW.
C
C  ARGUMENT DEFINITIONS:
C    ISPC = NUMERIC SPECIES CODE
C       D = DIAMETER AT BREAST HEIGHT
C       H = TOTAL TREE HEIGHT
C     JCR = CROWN RATIO IN PERCENT (0-100)
C       P = TREES PER ACRE
C   LTHIN = .TRUE. IF THINNING HAS JUST OCCURRED
C         = .FALSE. OTHERWISE
C    CCFT = CCF REPRESENTED BY THIS TREE
C  CRWDTH = CROWN WIDTH OF THIS TREE
C    MODE = 1 IF ONLY NEED CCF RETURNED
C           2 IF ONLY NEED CRWDTH RETURNED
