C  Purpose :
C     Determines how many races of bark beetle type 4 are eligible to
C     act in this growth cycle under current stand conditions.  The
C     mortality rates etc. specified for each beetle race that is
C     active are reported back to RDOAGM.  By default, each race that
C     was scheduled for this time period is rescheduled for the next
C     time period (whether it was active this time or not, unless the
C     user specifies otherwise).

C                  (live or newly dead) 
C              5 = infected mortality rate

C              9 = outside center+fringe mortality rate

C  Revision History :
C     06/12/96 - Matthew K. Thompson
C                Moved the declaration of DSII to the parameter
C                include file RDPARM.
C
C     03/04/98 - Robert N. Havis
C                Increased size of arrays PREVA and PREVB from 2 to 4
C                to accomodate 4 types of root diseases. Increase 
C                corresponding number of loops in statement 500 and 501
C    06-AUG-01 Lance R. David (FHTET)
C       Change MYACT to IACTK in call to OPCOPY because of array to scalar
C       mismatch reported by LF95.
C    10-DEC-07 Lance R. David (FHTET)
C       Update to argument list in call to OPCOPY, added variable
C       DONE for debug/tracking (from Don Robinson).
C   08/26/14 Lance R. David (FMSC)
C     Added implicit none and declared variables.
