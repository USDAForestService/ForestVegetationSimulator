C---------- 
C
C  Purpose :
C     Determines how many races of bark beetle type 1 are eligible to
C     act in this growth cycle under current stand conditions.  The
C     mortality rates etc. specified for each beetle race that is active
C     are reported back to RDOAGM.  By default, each race  that was
C     scheduled for this time period is rescheduled for the next time
C     period (whether it was active this time or not, unless the user
C     specifies otherwise).

C     Keyword:  BBTYPE1
C     Inputs:  1 = first outbreak year    2 = host tree species
C              3 = DBH limit              4 = threshold density of
C                                             lg.enough host
C              5 = mortality rate         6 = 0 for reschedule, 1 for
C                                             don't
C
C     Keyword:  DNSCALC
C     Inputs:  1 = 0 for actual trees/acre count, 1 for SDI calculation
C              2 = 0 for whole stand, 1 for outside only
C              3 = 0 for live only, 1 for live + died during last 2 years
C              4 = slope of SDI function (between -0.5 and -2.5)

C  Revision History:
C    21-MAR-00 Lance David (FHTET)
C       Reduced RETURN statements to 1 at the end of routine.
C       Added Debug code.
C    06-AUG-01 Lance R. David (FHTET)
C       Change MYACT to IACTK in call to OPCOPY because of array to scalar
C       mismatch reported by LF95.
C    10-DEC-07 Lance R. David (FHTET)
C       Update to argument list in call to OPCOPY, added variable
C       DONE for debug/tracking (from Don Robinson).
C   08/26/14 Lance R. David (FMSC)
C     Added implicit none and declared variables.
