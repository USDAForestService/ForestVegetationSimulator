C  Purpose :
C     This routine processes the root disease damage codes.
C
C  Called By :
C     DAMCDS  [FVS]
C
C  Calls :
C     DBCHK   (SUBROUTINE)   [PROGNOSIS]
C     RDROOT  (SUBROUTINE)   [ROOT DISEASE]
C     RDSSIZ  (SUBROUTINE)   [ROOT DISEASE]
C     RDSTP   (SUBROUTINE)   [ROOT DISEASE]
C
C  Arguments : 
C     II     - INT, (I)
C              Tree pointer (tree record number).
C     ICODES - INT, (I)
C              Damage/Severity codes array.
C
C  FVS common tree level arrays used:
C     IMC    - Management Code replaced use of input Tree history code.
C     IDTREE - Tree identification.
C     PROB   - Tree tally ..not the sampling probability.
C     HT     - Recorded tree height.
C     DBH    - Recorded diameter.
C     ISP    - Tree species numberic code.
C     ITRE   - Plot identification.
C     ITRUNC - Recorded truncated height.
C
C  Local Variables : 
C     IDAMC  - INT
C              Array which holds the damage codes for each root disease type.
C     NSRD   - INT
C              index to IDAMC array holding non-specific root disease damage code.

C  Common block variables used :
C
C  Revision History :
C  04/18/97 - Matthew K. Thompson
C    If a tree record's tree species was not of a root disease
C    host the model was trying to place it in a plot as an
C    uninfected tree.  Now if it is of a non-host species the tree
C    record is skipped and the subroutine is exited.
C  04/15/04 - Lance R. David (FHTET)
C    Added recognition of damage code 60 (non-specific root disease)
C    so that tree records with code 60 will be included with any
C    disease type (RRTYPE) specified for the simulation.
C  03/25/05 - Lance R. David (FHTeT)
C    Parenthesis were added to the conditional statements in the
C    processing of the damage codes. The default order of evaluation
C    resulted in (A or (B and C and D)) in stead of the correct 
C    evaluation order of ((A or B) and C and D). This resulted in
C    infected trees being interpreted as uninfected.
C  07/10/07 - Lance R. David (FHTET)
C    Time at which damage codes are processed is now at the end of 
C    keyword processing instead of during the reading of tree data.
C    So, tree data items that were passed as arguments are now 
C    available from the FVS common area. Original arguments were:
C    (II,IITH,IDD,ICODES,PROBB,HHT,DDBH,IISPI,ITREII,TTHT)
C    FVS array IMC(II) is used as replacement for input tree history
C    code (IITH).
C    No need for special handling of dead tree index (IREC2) because
C    dead trees are already at the end of the arrays. Argument II is
C    correct index value for both live and dead.
C   08/28/14 Lance R. David (FMSC)
C     Added implicit none and declared variables.
