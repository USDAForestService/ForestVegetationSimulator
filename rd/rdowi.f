C  Purpose :
C     Windthrow model subroutine.  This subroutine is used to
C     normalize the array that holds the relative susceptibility 
C     to windthrow for each tree species.
C
C  Called By :
C     RDOAGM  [ROOT DISEASE]
C
C  Local Variables :
C     ISPI   - INT
C              Counter used to loop through the tree species.
C              Used as index to species arrays.
C     SUM    - REAL
C              Sum of all tree species susceptibilites to windthrow.
C
C  Common Block Variables Used :
C     IRTSPC - (RDCOM)   (I)
C     MAXSP  - (PRGPRM)  (I)
C     ROWIBP - (RDCOM)   (I/O)
