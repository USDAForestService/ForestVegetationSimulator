C  THIS SUBROUTINE CALCULATES THE RATE OF SPREAD OF DISEASE CENTER
C  BY SIMULATING THE SPREAD THROUGH A SMALL STAND IN WHICH THE
C  TREES ARE REPRESENTED EXPLICITLY.

C  NOTES:
C    PNINF is here taken to be the probability of infection PER infected
C       tree contacted FOR PINT years. (where PINT is currently set to
C       10 years)
C    While the infection is growing into the tree center, the radius of
C       infection - RADINF - is negative and indicates how far the
C       infection is from the center.  RADINF is positive once the
C       infections starts spreading outwards.  RADINF will be positive
C       at the time of infection. Infection is from a neighbour whose
C       radius of infection overlaps the stump of the focal tree.
C
C SOME VARIABLES:
C   DISTNC(i,j)  the distance between the centers of each pair of trees
C   EFFSDI(1)    the effect of Stand Density Index for tree species 1,
C                equal to the proportion of the species-typical root
C                radius actually realized, given the total stand density
C   FINT         growth cycle used in the Annosus model
C   IRRSP        RR species to be modelled
C   IRSNYR       number of time periods for which to model RR spread
C   IRSTYP       1 = place trees randomly on sample plot
C                0 = regularly space trees on sample plot
C   IRTSPC(1)    maps Annosus tree species codes to FVS species codes
C   MCRATE(NMONT)  the spread rates determined by each Monte Carlo
C                simulation
C   NMONT        number of times to repeat MonteCarlo simulation of
C   NOW, NEW     pointers that indicate the present and future RADINF
C   NRSTEP       number of years in each time period
C   NTREES       actual number of trees used in the simulation
C                spread rate
C   NUMPAL(I), IDPAL(I, J)  Respectively, the number of trees with
C                which each focal tree 'i' has root contact ("pals"),
C                and the identity of those contact trees, for each
C                focal tree
C   PAREA(1)     area of the stand infected with RR species 1, in acres
C   PCOLO(1)     proportion of roots colonized after death of tree of
C                species1
C   PKILLS(1)    proportion of roots infected at death of tree of
C                species 1
C   PNINF(1)     probability of infection of tree species 1
C   RKILLS(i)    the radius of infection at which tree 'i' will die
C   ROOM         0/1 to indicate whether infection has crossed the
C                sample plot.  If it has, the rate of spread is
C                determined from the extent of infection at the end of
C                the previous period
C   RRGEN(IRRSP,2) target number of trees to put on sample plot
C   RRRATE(IRRSP), SDRATE(IRRSP)  the average and the s.d. of the
C   RRSARE       area of the sample plot used in the simulation
C   RRSFRN       the amount of random variation when trees are evenly
C                spaced
C   RRSMEN -
C   RRSRAD(i)    the species-typical root radius for a tree with the
C                DBH of tree 'i'
C   SAREA        stand area in acres
C   SFPROB       the density of uninfected trees outside desease
C                centers for the stand as a whole
C   SICK(i)      0/1 to indicate whether tree 'i' is infected
C   SINE(i)      the SIN of the angle of contact with infection for
C                each tree
C   TRURAD(i)    the realized root radius of each tree 'i', given EFFSDI
C   UPDATE       1 = update RADINF when infection from a neighbour has
C                    spread beyond the infection of the focal tree
C                0 = don't update
C   UPLTD        (UPDATE LIMITED) 1 = RADINF cannot be increased past
C                a tree's center by later contact with an infected
C                neighbour, 0 = it can be.  Where the increase in
C                RADINF is limited to the center, an increment of
C                between 0 and NRSTEP-1 years internal spread is added
C                (based on a random number).  This is because infection
C                will have been present for this long, on average,
C                before it is noted by the program
C                spread rates
C   YTK(i)       the years required for rr to kill a tree with the DBH
C                of tree 'i'.  We don't know whether this is time from
C                first infection, of time from infection of the center
C   YTKX         a multiplier of the YTK values calculated from a
C                linear equation
