C----------
C
C  THIS SUBROUTINE CALCULATES SPREAD RATE TO APPLY TO EACH CENTER
C  USING THE RANGE OF VALUES CALCULATED BY THE SPREAD RATE MODEL.
C  CENTERS THAT HAD A ZERO SPREAD RATE LAST YEAR ARE MORE LIKELY TO
C  HAVE A ZERO SPREAD RATE THIS YEAR UNLESS THOSE CENTERS ARE SHRINKING
C  CENTERS.
C
C  CALLED BY :
C     RDSPRD  [ROOT DISEASE]
C
C  CALLS     :
C     DBCHK   (SUBROUTINE)   [PROGNOSIS]
C
C  DEFINITIONS:
C     RRA:    CALCULATED SPREAD RATE FOR EACH CENTER 
C     NSIM:   NUMBER OF SIMULATIONS THAT WERE DONE BY THE MONTE CARLO SPREAD MODEL
C     MCRATE: THE RESULT OF EACH OF THE NSIM SIMULATIONS
C     GCENTS: THE NUMBER OF NON-SHRINKING CENTERS (POTENTIALLY GROWING CENTERS)
C
C  Revision History:
C    25-APR-00 Lance R. David (FHTET)
C       Reduced RETURN statements to 1 at the end of routine.
C       Added Debug code.
C    06-AUG-01 Lance R. David (FHTET)
C       Initialization of entire arrays RRA and IPNT instead of just the number
C       of elements represented equal to the current number of centers. That
C       method left calculations using uninitialized elements when the number of
C       disease centers exceeded the number of Monte Carlo simulations.
C   09/02/14 Lance R. David (FMSC)
C     Added implicit none and declared variables.
