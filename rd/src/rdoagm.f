C  Purpose :
C     This subroutine calls "OTHER AGENT" sub-models. 
C
C  Called By :
C     RDTREG  [ROOT DISEASE]
C
C  Calls :
C     RDOWI   (SUBROUTINE)   [ROOT DISEASE]
C     RDOWIN  (SUBROUTINE)   [ROOT DISEASE]
C     RDBB1   (SUBROUTINE)   [ROOT DISEASE]
C     RDBB2   (SUBROUTINE)   [ROOT DISEASE]
C     RDBB3   (SUBROUTINE)   [ROOT DISEASE]
C     RDBB4   (SUBROUTINE)   [ROOT DISEASE]
C
C  Common Block Variables Used :
C     NUMBB  - Number of Bark Beetles eligible to act in this time
C              period, which cannot exceed 3*MAXSP
C     FRINGE(ITOTRR) - The area in the stand that is within an average
C              root radius of a root rot infection center, for each
C              root rot type.  This area may experience greater
C              mortality due to bark beetles.
C     HOST(3*MAXSP) - Host tree species on which each beetle acts
C     MINDBH(3*MAXSP) - MINimum host DBH at which trees become
C              susceptible to each BB.
C     MININF(3*MAXSP) - Minimum proportion of roots infected at which
C              IIRATE applies.
C     ORATE(3*MAXSP) - Mortality rate outside infection centers (and
C              any associated 'fringe') caused by each BB.
C     OFRATE(3*MAXSP) - Mortality rate outside infection centers in the
C              'Fringe' area that may experience greater mortality.
C     IURATE(3*MAXSP) - Mortality rate inside infection centers of
C              uninfected trees, for each BB.
C     IIRATE(3*MAXSP) Mortality rate inside infection centers of
C              infected trees, for each BB.

C  Revision History :
C     08/07/97 - Matthew K. Thompson
C                Removed section of code that modified PROBI due to      
C                windthrow.  Decided that windthrow mortality needed
C                to be removed from PROBI in the subroutine RDOWIN.
C   08/29/14 Lance R. David (FMSC)
C     Added implicit none and declared variables.
