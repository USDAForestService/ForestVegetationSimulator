C  Revision History:
C     21-MAR-00 Lance David (FHTET)
c       Removed equivalence of FVS array WK6 to RD array SPCNT and
C       corrected the initialization process of SPCNT based on
C       parameter MAXSP instead of literal 11.
C       Reduced RETURN statements to 1 at the end of routine.
C       Added debug code.
C     25-MAR-2003 Lance R. David (FHTET)
C       WK2 from ARRAYS common area is reset to zero before compression of
C       treelist is requested. SVS processing had used WK2 and left residual
C       values in it and comprs expects values in WK2 to be mortality which
C       has not yet been predicted.
C       Gary Dixon and Lance David discussed this problem and agreed
C       on this solution to reset WK2 in this routine.
C   08/29/14 Lance R. David (FMSC)
C     Added implicit none and declared variables.

C     25-MAR-2003
C     The FVS compression routine expects values in the WK2 array to
C     be mortality. Mortality has not been predicted at this time, but
C     other processes (SVS) may have used WK2 and left residual values.
C     WK2 needs to be reset to zero for compression to function properly.
C     As of this date, the next user of the WK2 array is CUTS which
C     stores (not retrieves) removal priority values in WK2.
C     This change was discussed and agreed upon by Gary Dixon and Lance David.
