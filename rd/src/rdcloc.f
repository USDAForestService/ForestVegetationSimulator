C     IF TOO MANY TRIES ARE REQUIRED TO LOCATE A CENTER SO THAT IT

C     ATTAINABLE.

C     IF THE STAND IS TO BE RUN AS ONE CENTER THEN MAKE SURE THAT STAND
C     AREA IS COMPLETELY COVERED BY THE CENTER. ASSUME THAT THE RADIUS 
C     OF THE CENTER IS EQUAL TO HALF THE DIAGONAL OF THE STAND (USE
C     PYTHAGORAS: R^2 = (.5 * DIMEN)^2 + (.5 * DIMEN)^2). ALSO ASSUME
