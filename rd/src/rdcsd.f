C  Purpose :
C    CALCULATES THE CRITICAL STAND DENSITY THAT DETERMINES WHETHER OR 
C    NOT AN OUTBREAK OF BARK BEETLE 1 OCCURS.
C    Depending on the arguments supplied to the keyword DNSCALC, the user
C    can select from the following to define the critical density:
C
C    METHOD: STEM or SDI
C    SPACE:  ALL or OUTSDE
C    DTYPE:  LIVE or ALL
C
C    where:
C
C    STEM    is stems/acre greater than the DBHLIM supplied
C    SDI     is Reinecke's Stand Density Index.  This method sums host +
C            non-host trees if SPACE ALL is selected.  If SPACE OUTSDE is
C            selected, only BB host trees outside root rot centers are
C            included.  In neither case is DBHLIM used to screen out trees.
C    ALL     for SPACE, includes the whole stand area, both inside and
C             outside of root rot infection centers.
C            for DTYPE, includes all live trees (whether infected or not), 
C             AND all trees that died during the last two years (whether
C             infected or not, and without regard to the cause of death). 
C    OUTSDE  includes only areas outside root rot-infected areas
C    LIVE    includes only living trees (both infected and not infected).
C
C    The meaning of THRESH depends upon the METHOD; it can be either 
C    stems/acre or the SDI value.
C
C  CALLED BY :
C     RDBB1  [ROOT DISEASE]
C
C  CALLS     :
C     DBCHK  (SUBROUTINE)   [PROGNOSIS]
C
C  PARAMETERS :
C     ISPI - the species targetted by the beetle      (INTEGER)
C     DBHLIM - the dbh limit when the METHOD is STEM  (REAL)
C     THRESH - the threshold stems/acre or SDI value  (REAL)
C     CRIT - exceeds critical value for outbreak      (LOGICAL)
C
C  VARIABLES
C     TOTDEN = the TOTal DENsity over the whole stand of trees that
C              meet the user's criteria
C     NSUM   = Number SUM - a sum of numbers of trees that meet the
C              user's criteria
C     DOSUM  = Density Outside SUM - a sum of the density outside centers
C              of trees that meet the user's criteria
C     BASUM  = Basal Area SUM - the total basal area in the stand of trees
C              that meet the user's criteria
C     PIBY4  = PI divided BY 4, used to save work in iterative computation
C     PIABY4 = PI * stand Area divided BY 4, used to save work

C  Revision History :
C     06/12/96  Matthew K. Thompson
C               Moved the declaration of DSO, DSII, and DSIU to the
C               parameter include file RDPARM.
C     21-MAR-00 Lance David (FHTET)
C               Changed local variable "SLOPE" to "REISLP" because SLOPE
C               is a FVS variable in common PLOT.F77. 
C     15-JUL-02 Lance David (FHTET)
C               Added debug.
C   08/28/14 Lance R. David (FMSC)
C     Added implicit none and declared variables.
