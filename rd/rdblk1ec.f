C.... The array IRTSPC is used to index the species dependent arrays
C.... HABFAC, PNINF, PKILLS, RRJSP, ISPS, DBIFAC, HTIFAC, PROOT,
C.... RSLOP, ROWDOM, ROWIBP, RRPSWT, SSSFAC, IDITYP, PCOLO.
C.... In the root disease model, the defaults for these variables 
C.... are indexed as follows :
C....
C.... Species #|  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |  7 |  8 |  9 | 10 |

C....
C.... IRTSPC can be modified for different variants of FVS so
C.... that species match between FVS and the root disease
C.... model.

C.... The following IRTSPC is for the EC (32 species) variant.
