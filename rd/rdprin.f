C  THIS SUBROUTINE CALCULATES THE NUMBER OF TREES PER ACRE THAT EACH
C  TREE RECORD REPRESENTS FOR THE ROOT DISEASE MODEL TREE CLASSES PROBI,
C  FPROB,PROBIU AND PROPI. THIS ROUTINE IS CALLED FROM NOTRE. THESE
C  INITIAL CALCULATIONS ARE MODIFIED IN RRINIT TO PUT THEM ON THE PROPER
C  ACERAGE BASIS. IPRFL=0 IF TREE IS OUTSIDE DISEASE PATCH,IPRFL=1-3
C  IF TREE IS INSIDE PATCH AND INFECTED WITH CORRESPONDING SEVERITY,
C  IPRFL=4 IF IT IS A DEAD INFECTED STUMP AND IPRFL=5 IF TREE IS INSIDE 
C  PATCH AND NOT INFECTED  
C  THIS ROUTINE IS SKIPPED IF THE DISEASE IS BEING INITIALIZED MANUALLY

C REVISION HISTORY:
C   21-MAY-2002  Lance R. David (FHTET)
C     The previous date of change was March 1, 1995.
C     The TPA represented by dead tree records was unadjusted as
C     described at the point of change below and further described in
C     the FVS subroutine NOTRE. To facilitate the unadjustment, FVS
C     common PLOT.F77 was added.
C     This error was discovered by Don Robinson of ESSA.
C   17-JUN-2002  Lance R. David (FHTET)
C     Added debug.
C   08/29/14 Lance R. David (FMSC)
C     Added implicit none and declared variables.
