This document describes the files present in the National Volume Estimator Library (volume/VolumeLibrary) 
that have been modified for FVS, stored directly under the volume directory, and are to be used for build source files.
These files should remain under the volume/ directory and referred to in the FVSxx_sourceList.txt files as ..volume/<fileName>, 
while all other NVEL code should be referred to under the volume library directory ..volume/VolumeLibrary/<NVEL_filename>

CALCDIA.F subroutine CALCDIA2: 
Added filter for HTTOT less than 5 to prevent raising a negative number to a power (08/22)

f_other.f: 
Increased filter on DR variable from IF(DR.GT.0.0) to IF(DR.GT.0.01) to prevent underflow error when computing PV in brk_ot subroutine. (08/22)

mrules_mod.f:
Removal of nonconforming tab characters

pnwtarif.f:
Moved initialization of variables CT4, CVT, CVTS, and TARIF prior to any regional filtering to prevent use of uninitialized variables in R5 logic (11/22)

PROFILE.F subroutines, VOLINTRP and PROFILE: 
Added initialization of variables otherwise uninitialized prior to variables being passed to MRULES. (08/22)

R1KEMP.F subroutine R1KEMP: 
Added initialization of BFNET variable to prevent nan error in logical comparison. (08/22)

R2oldv.f:
File modified to include initialization of TCUFT to 0.0 to prevent evaluation of uninitialized variable (11/22)

r4vol.f: 
increased HTTOT filter from HTTOT .LE. 4.5 to HTTOT .LE. 5.0 to prevent a divide by zero error in the STUMPD calculation within r4mattaper subroutine. (08/22)

R8CLKDIB.F subroutine R8CLKDIB: 
Added initialization of COEFFS Type (Struct) variables to prevent underflow or nan errors in subsequent calculations. (08/22)

r8prep.f:
Added initialization of variables otherwise uninitialized prior to variables being passed to MRULES. (08/22)
Increased filter to catch trees less than 17.4' in height to ensure dubbed top ht is used in place of total measured ht in tree 17.3-17.4 ft (09/22)

r8vol2.f:
Added initialization of variables otherwise uninitialized prior to variables being passed to MRULES in r8clark subroutine. (08/22)

r9clark:
Added initialization of variables otherwise uninitialized prior to variables being passed to MRULES in r9prep subroutine. (08/22)
Increased filter to catch trees less than 17.4' in height to ensure dubbed top ht is used in place of total measured ht in tree 17.3-17.4 ft (09/22)

R10D2H.f:
Moved initialization of local variables to prevent use of uninitialized variables in R5 logic (11/22)

voleqdef.f:
This file was modified during AK variant development to expand available species.
species code 298 recoded to 299
File again modified in October 2022 to expand available voleq set to encompass entire volume equation library list of possible equations, 
with exception of Flewelling 3 pt profiles models. (10/22)
