Subject: ThinRDen Thinning to Curtis Relative Density

Variants affected: All

Description:

 The update of entry RDLCS in sdical.f was returning parameters compatible
 for the computation of Curtis Relative Density values with Event Monitor
 SpMcDBH function, but not compatible for the processing of ThinRDen 
 activity. Two additional arguments were added to sdical.f ENTRY RDCLS so
 that both sets of necessary parameters are returned.

Impact on users: ThinRDen is again functioning as it did with previous
                 FVS release (VERSION 2063, RV: 20180108).
