Subject: Added soil heating from fofem
Name: Nicholas Crookston
Date: 03/30/2006
Variants affected: All FFE

Description: This code addes soil heating routines from fofem to the FFE.
 The code is a direct use of fofem and is the first time FVS is being based
 on the mixture of Fortran and C.

 This project is not done. The fmsoilheat routine is only a shell that
 loads constant initial values and returns the same answers for every call.
 This part will be done soon but will only affect a few routines very
 likely it will not effect the link files.

Impact on users: NONE unless they use the new SoilHeat keyword.

Files:

bin/FC.make -- added xlc compilier for c routines
bin/FCWindows_NT.make -- added gcc compilier for c routines
bin/makefile -- added FIRE_FOFEM_LINK and placed it in the link list where
                    fm programs are built
                added fire_fofem_compile and placed it in the dependency
                    list where fm programs are built
