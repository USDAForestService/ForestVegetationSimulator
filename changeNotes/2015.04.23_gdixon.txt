Subject: Revamping the two FVS-Organon variants for production use
Name: Gary Dixon
Date: 04/23/15
Variants affected: OC and OP

Description: The OC and OP are variants incorporate the ORGANON growth model into FVS using the CA and PN
variants, respectively, as the starting points. The OC variant incorporates the ORGANON Southwest Oregon model type;
the OP variant the ORGANON Northwest Oregon and Stand Management Co-op model types. The resulting code is now being 
revamped to eliminate errors, make available the full array of FVS keyword options, and revamp the code conform to 
established code standards for ease of maintainence and updating.

base/src
     initre.f  changed verbiage of ORGANON keyword; added LNOTRE to the argument list for ORIN
  
organon/src
  ORGANON.F77  added variables LORGPREP, MSDI_1, MSDI_2, MSDI_3
     orin.f    new routine replacing OC and OP variant specific versions; clean up the code and added two more
               fields to the ORGINFO keyword
org_intree.f   new routine to read an Organon .inp file

oc/src
     cratet.f  added the variable LORGPREP; corrected the setting of variable STAGE; deleted setting of RVARS array;
               added loading of RADGRO array with diameter growth measurements; added code to skip call to PREPARE if
               it isn't needed (i.e. start from an Organon .inp file)
     grinit.f  changed default Organon even/uneven setting to even-aged stand;
               initialized variables MSDI_1, MSDI_2, MSDI_3 to zero; initialized LORGPREP to .FALSE.
     morts.f   revised to use FVS mortality if Organon mortality has not been estimated
      orin.f   deleted
     sitset.f  set even/uneven Organon setting to even-aged and stand management flag to managed if stand age from STDINFO is zero; 
               corrected setting of RVARS array; set MSDI_1, MSDI_2, and MSDI_3 if they haven't been set

op/src
     cratet.f  added the variable LORGPREP; corrected the setting of variable STAGE; deleted setting of RVARS array;
               added loading of RADGRO array with diameter growth measurements; added code to skip call to PREPARE if
               it isn't needed (i.e. start from an Organon .inp file)

               initialized variables MSDI_1, MSDI_2, MSDI_3 to zero; initialized LORGPREP to .FALSE.
     grohed.f  change leading '1' to // in the header format
     morts.f   revised to use FVS mortality if Organon mortality has not been estimated
      orin.f   deleted
     sitset.f  set even/uneven Organon setting to even-aged and stand management flag to managed if stand age from STDINFO is zero; 
               corrected setting of RVARS array; set MSDI_1, MSDI_2, and MSDI_3 if they haven't been set

FVSoc_sourceList.txt  added ca\src\varmrt to the source list; changed ORIN to come from ORGANON\SRC instead of OC\SRC;
                      added organon\src\org_intree

FVSop_sourceList.txt  changed ORIN to come from ORGANON\SRC instead of OP\SRC; added organon\src\org_intree
