Subject: Miscellaneous code changes, corrections, and cleanup

Variants affected: SO33

Description: 1) When this variant was expanded from 11 species to 33 species, equations
                for the additional species were taken from other variants. Several
                inconsistencies between the code in SO33 and the code in the original
                variants have been corrected.
             2) Some code has been reorganized to improve execution efficiency.
             3) Comment statements have been corrected or improved to aid in code
                maintenance


Impact on users: Users of the SO variant should obtain a new executable. Small differences
                 will be noted in projections involving quaking aspen and whitebark pine.

Files:
so33/src     maical.f     changed the date of revision; corrected the WJ surrogate
                          equation from 122 to 101 to match the UT variant
so33/src     sitset.f     changed the date of revision; cleaned up some 
                          code spacing and comment statements; corrected mixed
                          mode comparisons at lines 162 and 197; changed the argument
                          list to subroutine HTCALC back to standard list; eliminated
                          variable IDUM
so33/src     findag.f     changed the date of revision; variables RELSI and RSIMOD, and
                          therefore variables SLO and SHI, were not being used and were
                          eliminated; changed the argument list to subroutine HTCALC back
                          to standard list; inserted a code section to deal with aspen,
                          juniper, and whitebark pine
so33/src     regent.f     changed the date of revision; corrected the comment at line 39
so33/src     htcalc.f     changed the date of revision; took the height growth equations for
                          whitebark pine, western juniper, and quaking aspen out of this routine 
                          and moved them to subroutine HTGF (note: HTCALC should only be used for 
                          site index curves which are a function of age; it should never be used 
                          for height growth equations. This change corrects looping problems with 
                          with these species when this routine is called from FINDAG); corrected
                          the species test from 6 (aspen in the UT variant) to 24 (aspen in the
                          SO33 variant) involved in setting elevation for aspen; restored the 
                          argument list to the standard HTCALC list; deleted the include statements
                          for common blocks ARRAYS, CONTRL, and PLOT (note: I checked the makefile
                          to take these out of the dependency list for this routine, but they
                          weren't there to start with)
so33/src     htgf.f       changed the date of revision; added growth equations for whitebark pine,
                          western juniper, and quaking aspen; changed the argument list to
                          subroutine HTCALC back to the standard list; deleted the unused array AB
so33/src     morts.f      changed the date of revision; changed the background mortality coefficients
                          for whitebark pine to match those found in the TT variant (PMSC changed
                          from 9.6943 to 6.5112, PMD changed from -0.0127328 to -0.0052485)
so33/src     smhtgf.f     changed the date of revision; added the setting of HHT to zero (this
                          variable was not being set if DTIME was zero)
so33/src     dubscr.f     changed the date of revision; corrected the BCR1 coefficient for AS from
                          0.0 to -0.093105
