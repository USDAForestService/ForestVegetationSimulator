Subject: Subroutine Argument Correction
Name: R. Havis
Date: April 10, 2012
Variants affected: EC

Description: The species list for the East Cascades variant was expanded
             on April 2, 2012 (see FVS Update Bulletin No. 720). A problem
             was created at this time that could cause a runtime error. This
             has been corrected.


Impact on users: Users of the EC variant should download a new executable.

Files:
./base/src/revise.f
./ec/src/htdbh.f - added the variable IGL to the INTEGER declaration statement
./fire/base/src/fmcrowe.f - added the argument IGL to the HTDBH subroutine call statement
