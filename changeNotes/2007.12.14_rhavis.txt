Subject:R9 Vol. Eq. Table With SN Variant
Name: R. Havis
Date: December 14, 2007
Variants affected: SN

Description: Two Region 9 forests (Mark Twain NF, forest code 905, and the Shawnee NF,
             forest code 908) may be run using the Southern variant. When running
             these forests the NATIONAL VOLUME ESTIMATOR LIBRARY EQUATION NUMBER
             Table was not being written to the main output file.
             This has been corrected

Impact on users: Users should obtain new executables

Files:
./base/src/initre.f - eliminated redundant calls to VARVER
./base/src/revise.f
./sn/obj/makefile - added SECOM.F77 to dependencies in compile instructions
                    for SITSET
./sn/src/grohed.f - Change version number from 1.00 to 6.21
./sn/src/sitset.f - added SECOM.F77 in included statement and added logic
                    for setting R9 volume Eq. Nos.
