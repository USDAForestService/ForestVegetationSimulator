Description: Added sprout TPA minimum of 0.001 in order for a tree record to be
             added. This was to address occurrence of negative TPA values that
             can be returned by essprt.f as well as not adding tree records of
             insignificant TPA representation to the projection.

Impact on users: This change will have minor impacts on projections because some
                 sprout records will not be added to the projection as they were
                 before, but this TPA threshold is so small that it may not be
                 noticed in summary values.
