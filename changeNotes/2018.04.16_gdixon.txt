Subject: Stagnation effect (field 7 SDIMAX keyword)
         Crown ratio dubbing

Variants affected: Central Rockies (CR), Tetons (TT), Utah (UT), Western Sierra Nevada (WS)

Description: Stand density is used to compute a stagnation multiplier that is applied to diameter and height
             growth estimates when turned on using field 7 of the SDIMAX keyword. The stagnation multiplier
             can be applied to all species in the Central Rockies variant; species 15 = narrowleaf cottonwood and 
             18 = other hardwoods in the TT variant; and species 17 = Great Basin bristlecone pine, 18 = narrowleaf
             cottonwood, 19 = Fremont cottonwood, and 22 = boxelder in the UT variant.
             The SDIMAX keyword was not allowing the stagnation multiplier to be turned on in the TT or UT variants.
             The staganation multiplier was not being applied during large tree diameter growth calibration.
             Both of these problems have been fixed.
             
             A potential problem with crown ratio dubbing in the second or subsequent stands in multi-stand runs
             when certain other conditions exist was fixed.   
             
Impact on users: Users of the CR, TT, and UT variants should obtain a new executable.

   initre.f  The TT and UT variants were added as valid variants for processing field 7 of the SDIMAX keyword, and
             processing of field 7 of the SDIMAX keyword was changed to a SELECT CASE structure.  

   sdical.f  The tree index pointers that indicate where tree data is stored in the tree arrays were added to all 
             DO loops going from 1 to ITRN. Code was then added to skip dead trees in the initial inventory where
             appropriate.
