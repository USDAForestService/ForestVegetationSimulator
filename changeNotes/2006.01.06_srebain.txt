Subject: Fire and Fuels Extension - Snag Dynamics Update
Name:  Stephanie Rebain
Date:  01/06/2006
Variants affected: Blue Mountains (BM), Oregon portion of Southern Oregon and Northeast California (SO), 
                   East Cascades (EC), Pacific Northwest (PN), West Cascades (WC)

Description:
The snag predictions were updated in the Region 6 FFE variants.  Specifically, the
rates at which snags fall, decay, and lose height were adjusted to match those based 
on work by Kim Mellen, region 6 wildlife ecologist. 

Impact on users:
The number of snag standing over time will change.  This will also affect the accumulation
of surface fuel and affect predicted fuel loading, fire behavior, and fire effects.

These changes will be documented in the next version of the FFE addendum document.
