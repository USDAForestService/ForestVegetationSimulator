Subject: SDI Calculation and Curtis RD added to SpMcDBH function

Variants affected: All

Description: Loop control variable in sdi calculations (sdical.f) changed from
ITRN (total tree records) to IREC1 (projectable/live tree records). Using ITRN
caused process to enter indices that did not contain tree data because the
incoming mortality status of the tree records placed them at the end of the 
arrays.
Bryan Lu (WA DNR) provided an update for the addition of returning the
partitioned Curtis relative density value with the SpMcDBH Event Monitor
function. His code was integrated into evldx.f routine. This is option #14
for the function and behaves like all other options with the inclusion of the
controlling paramters.
***
Earlier modification to sdical.f that did not get into a change note was
the ENTRY RDCLS code for the summation method of calculating relative density
was replaced with code developed by Bryan Lu, F. Martin, and R. Johnson 
(WA Department of Natural Resources). This modification affects the specific
performance of the ThinRDen management action and the Event Monitor variables
BRDEN and ARDEN. This update went out with January 2018 release.

Impact on users: SDI calculation loop control only displayed minor changes in
results for varaints AK, WS and WC test runs with multiple stands in a serial
run. The addition of partitioned Curtis relative densitsy to the capabilities
of the SpMcDBH Event Monitor function is useful for computed variable and 
conditionals.

Files:
/base/src/evldx.f     Updated SpMcDBH for Curtis relative density return.
/base/src/sdical.f    Changed loop control from ITRN to IREC1. Entry RDCLS
                      was updated earlier with new process for calculating
                      Curtis' relative density.
