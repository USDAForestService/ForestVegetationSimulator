Variants affected: SN

Description: Shortleaf pine (< 7" dbh) was added to the sprouting 
             species list. Sprout estimates for all sprouting species
             were updated based on work from Keyser, T.L. and Loftis,
             D.L., Southern Research Station.  

Impact on users: Southern variant users should obtain new executables.
