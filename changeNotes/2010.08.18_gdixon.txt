Subject: 1) Large tree diameter growth model scale factors
         2) Species printing in Calibration Statistics Table

Variants affected: 1) West Cascades (WC) and Pacific Northwest Coast (PN)
                   2) All variants

Description:
1) Inconsistent results were being seen when using large tree diameter growth
   multipliers entered with the READCORD keyword in the WC and PN variants.
   Further investigation into this problem revealed that an incorrect array 
   species index was being used in loading and accessing the constant term in
   the large tree diameter growth model. This resulted in incorrect initial 
   large tree diameter growth scale factors being computed for white fir, 
   grand fir, incense-cedar, Engelmann/Sitka spruce, Jeffrey pine, sugar pine,
   western white pine, ponderosa pine, coast redwood, white alder/Pacific madrone,
   paper birch, giant chinkapin/tanoak, quaking aspen, black cottonwood, 
   western juniper, subalpine larch, whitebark pine, knobcone pine, Pacific yew,
   Pacific dogwood, hawthorn species, bitter cherry, willow species, and the
   other species grouping. Growth projections involving these species when 
   calibration of the large tree diameter growth model occurred, or when 
   READCORD multipliers were entered, for these species are also incorrect.
   This problem in the WC and PN variants has now been corrected.
   
2) When a single projection contained more than 11 species, the spacing of the
   species codes printed in the Calibration Statistics Table did not match the
   format used to print calibration values in all the western variants and in
   the Southern variant. This has been corrected and the coding in all variants
   has been standardized. Projections are not affected by this change.

Impact on users: Users of the WC and PN variants should obtain a new executable
                 as soon as possible. Users of all other variants can obtain a
                 new executable at their convenience.
