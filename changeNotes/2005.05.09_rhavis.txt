Description:

This code update creates a metric output option for SVS images.
FVS runs are unchanged. Users have the option of generating SVS output
based on the metric system (1 ha plots, DBH (cm), height (m)). All
combinations of current SVS keyword flags create outputs that are
identical (within SVS accuracy) to the non-metric outputs. These
include visual stand rendering (perspective view, overhead view,
profile view), graphical output (dbh, height and species distribution,
crown structure) and stand summary table.

A 6th field was added to the SVS keyword.

field 6: render SVS output in metric or imperial units (Default = 0)
	0		output is generated in imperial units
	1		output is generated in metric units

Note:
When rendering a perspective view of the stand using metric units
(field 6 = 1), the command line flags of SVS may need to be altered so
that a "classic" SVS stand view is drawn. Otherwise, the point of view
for the rendering will be too far from the stand. Suggested command-line
parameters for the square stand metric rendering are:

  -A315 -E82 -S38 -D226 -L51

In comparison, the default imperial rendering command line arguments
are:

  -A315 -E172 -S30 -D472 -L105

Stand and flame renderings and snag information from the FFE are also
available.

Impact on users: Metric SVS images can be produced using field 6 of
                 of the SVS keyword.
