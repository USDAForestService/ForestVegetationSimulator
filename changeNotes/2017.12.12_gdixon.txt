Subject: Miscellaneous changes in the FVS-ORGANON variants
Name: Gary Dixon
Date: 12/12/2017
Variants affected: OC and OP

Description: Continued enhancement of the OC and OP variants. Included in this group of changes:

1) Addition of event monitor variables to track key ORGANON parameters, percent canopy cover and
   average height of the 40 largest "Big 6" species trees.

2) Correction to volumes, when using the Oregon State University volume equations, for top-killed
   trees.


Impact on users: Users of these two variants should obtain a new executable. 

Files:

/bin/FVSoc_sourceList      Added subroutine organon/src/getorgv.f to the list

/bin/FVSop_sourceList      Added subroutine organon/src/getorgv.f to the list

/common/opcom.f77          Expanded the dimension of TSTV3 from 20 to 22.

/common/organon.f77        Added variables OCC and OAHT.

/base/src/algkey.f         Changed the value of N6 from 40 to 42. Added comments to define the new variables
                           ORG%CC and ORGAHT. Added the new variables to array CTAB6 and the corresponding option
                           codes to array IOPT6.

/base/src/evtstv.f         Added comments to define the new variables. Added calls to subroutine GETORGV to
                           retrieve values for the two new variables.
                           
/base/src/exorganon.f      Added entry point GETORGV.

/oc/src/dgdriv.f           Added variables OCC and OAHT to the call to subroutine EXECUTE.

/oc/src/grinit.f           Changed some comment statements. Initialized variables OCC and OAHT to zero.

/op/src/dgdriv.f           Added variables OCC and OAHT to the call to subroutine EXECUTE.

/op/src/grinit.f           Changed some comment statements. Initialized variables OCC and OAHT to zero.

/organon/src/execute.f     Add local variables OCC2 and OAHT2 to the EXECUTE call list. Add setting of 
                           variables OCC2 and OAHT2. 
                           
/organon/src/getorgv.f     New subroutine to send values for the ORGANON variables percent canopy cover
                           (OCC) and average height of the 40 largest trees (OAHT) to the event monitor.

/organon/src/varget.f      Changed the value of MXR from 14 to 16. Added variables OCC and OAHT.

/organon/src/varput.f      Changed the value of MXR from 14 to 16. Added variables OCC and OAHT.

/organon/src/vols.f        Send actual height of the tree (FVS variable HT(i)) to subroutine VOLCAL instead
                           of the normal height of the tree (FVS variable NORMHT(i)) for top-killed trees.
                           Modified the debug write statement before the call to subroutine VOLCAL.
                           Added a debug write statement after the call to subroutine VOLCAL.
