Description: Lodgepole MPB model and Western Root Disease model modified for the
             expansion from 24 species to 38 species. The Dwarf Mistletoe model
             was modified my Gary Dixon during his expansion of CR base FVS.


Impact on users: No impact on growth projections for the current 24 species. 
                 However, users wanting to take advantage of the expanded species
                 list should obtain a new variant executable.
