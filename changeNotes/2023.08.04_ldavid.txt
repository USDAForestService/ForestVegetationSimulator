Variants affected: Western US variants including DM and RD extentions

Description: FIA datasets prepared for FVS input contains FIA Damage Agent
             codes for dwarf distletoe and root disease. The Dwarf Mistletoe
             and Western Root Disease models damge code processing has been
             updated to recognize the appropriate codes. The reference for
             these codes was the FSVEG User Guide, Appendix K. Details of the
             damage code processing are:

             DWARF MISTLETOE
             When a FIA dwarf mistletoe damage code representing Arceuthobium
             is encountered, severity codes of 1-6 will be retained; otherwise,
             the severity code will be set to 3. Hosts of DM differs by FVS
             variant is controlled by the model to stay with specific host
             species where encountered in the input data if the tree species is
             specified as host in the model. If species is not specified as host
             in the model, damage code will be ignored.
             A significant difference with the handling of FVS codes (30-34) is
             that the severity code of 0 is interpreted as tree that was
             inspected for dwarf mistletoe and none was found; therefore, no
             default severity code is assigned as with the FIA codes getting a
             severity code of 3. This is to follow the historical field sampling
             protocols as opposed to the FIA codes that are recorded if dwarf
             mistletoe is found but severity is not recorded.

             WESTERN ROOT DISEASE
             Added new array for FIA Damage Agent codes (IFIADAM) which
             parallels the existing array holding the FVS damage codes (IDAMC)
             for represented root diseases. The IFIADAM array references were
             added to the conditionals so that FVS codes are checked first and
             then FIA codes. There are far more root disease agent codes in the
             FIA list than represented by the Root Disease Model and only the
             specific FIA codes are recognized. The RD model does recognize a
             non-specific disease type and that is paired with the FIA code
             21000. Severity code associated with root/butt disease with the
             FIA datasets are always a 2.


Impact on users: FIA Damage Agent codes for the specific agents recognized by
                 Dwarf Mistletoe model and Western Root Disease model are now
                 acknowleged by these FVS extentions.
