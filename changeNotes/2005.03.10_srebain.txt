Subject: Change to the SimFire keyword 
Name: Stephanie Rebain 
Date: March 10, 2005
Variants affected: All variants with FFE

Description: 
A 6th field was added to the SimFire keyword, to allow control over the 
percentage of the stand burned.  Currently, FFE assumes 100% of the stand
is burned, and 100% is the default value for this field.  Also, in
previous versions of the code, mortality was adjusted when flame lengths
were less than 2.5 feet, to account for the fact that the burn was
probably patchy and not thru the whole stand.  This adjustment was removed, since
users can now enter a specific percentage of the stand to be burned.  This 
new field affects simulated fires only; when assessing potential fire effects,
it is assumed that the whole stand is burned.

Impact on users:
This should only change output in simulations where simulated or potential fire
flame length was less than 2.5 feet. If users alter the percent of the stand 
burned so that it is less than 100%, there will be an impact with regard to 
mortality, fuel consumption, smoke production, and mineral soil exposure estimates.
The new SimFire keyword field will be available in the next update of Suppose. 
Users should be cautious in editing old keyword files with the updated version of
Suppose.  Specifically, when the SimFire keyword is present in a simulation, users
should delete the original SimFire keyword and then add it back in.  

Files:
fire/base/src/fmin.f - added the new 6th field to the Simfire keyword
fire/base/src/fmeff.f - passed in PSBURN and adjusted the mortality predictions to account 
                        for the percentage of the stand burned.  Took out the old
                        adjustment done at low flame lengths.  Adjusted the crown
                        consumption predictions.
fire/base/src/fmburn.f - added the new SimFire field and passed PSBURN to fmcons and fmeff.
fire/base/src/fmpofl.f - adjusted the call lists for the calls to fmcons and fmeff.
fire/base/src/fmtret.f - adjusted the call lists for the call to fmcons.
fire/ni/src/fmcons.f - passed in PSBURN and adjusted the fuel consumption
                       predictions to account for the percentage of the stand burned.
fire/so/src/fmcons.f - passed in PSBURN and adjusted the fuel consumption
                       predictions to account for the percentage of the stand burned.
