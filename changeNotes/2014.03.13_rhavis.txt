Description:

All variants: The ACORNS event monitor function returns the
number or weight of acorns from specified oak species. The
efficiency of the calculations has been improved to provide
faster model performance.

BM variant: The default SDImax values were not being set correctly
when the site species was set using the SITECODE keyword or from a
database. This has been corrected.
