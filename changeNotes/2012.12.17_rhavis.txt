Subject: Code Maintenance, Central Rockies Tree Age Correction
Name: R. Havis
Date: December 17, 2012
Variants affected: CR

Description: The age of the first tree in the tree list was being
             reset when a Plant or Natural keyword was used
             in the simulation. Because tree age is used in
             the height calculations, this problem affected
             growth. This has been corrected.


Impact on users: Central Rockies variant users should obtain a new
                 executable.
