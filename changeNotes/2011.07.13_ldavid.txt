Subject: Dwarf Mistletoe Height Growth Impact

Description: Height growth impacts due to dwarf mistletoe infection may be 
             added to projections. The new keyword/activity controlling
             this action is the MistHMod keyword, a schedulable event. It
             functions in the same manner as the diameter growth impacts by
             applying a proportional value from 0.0 to 1.0 a multiplier to 
             the FVS predicted height growth based on the tree record's DMR
             value.  On the keyword record the first field is year or cycle,
             and the second is the species code. A supplemental record
             contains height growth multiplier values for DMRs 1 thru 6
             with a space as a delimeter. There are no default height
             growth impacts assigned, so they must be specified on the 
             supplemental record.

             In order to simulate the results observed by Katy Mallams for
             her Douglas-fir study plots in Region 6, the keyword record
             would be as shown below.

             MistHMod        2007        DF
             1.  1.  0.95  0.65  0.50  0.00

             The effect would be to reduce the height growth for Douglas-fir
             trees with DMRs 1 through 6, respectively, to 100% (no additional
             impact),100% 95%, 65%, 50%, and 0% of the height growth predicted
             in the absense of this keyword.

Impact on users: Additional effects of height growth impact only if
                 specified with the inclusion of MistHMod keyword.
