Description:
         a) CR: CCF coefficient corection, corrected an error in the
                fire code
         b) SO: code cleanup, implementation of HCOR2 values from the
                READCORH keyword
         c) BM: corrected an error in the fire code
         d) EM: corrected an error in the fire code
         e) IE: code cleanup
         f) AK, AN, BM, CA, CS_NEW, EC, LS_NEW, NC, NE_NEW, SN, SO, SO33, WC:
                code cleanup for variables LHTDRG(ispc) and IABFLG(ispc)


Impact on users: Users should obtain a new executables. Results for 
                 base model projections may be slightly different due to these
                 changes; results for fire projections involving hardwoods in
                 the BM, CR, and EM variants will be different.
