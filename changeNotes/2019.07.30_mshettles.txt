Subject: Addition of the Inventory Statistics Tables to the Database Extension
Name: Mike Shettles
Date: 07/30/2019
Variants affected: All

Description: The two tables that are produced with usage of the base model
STATS keyword have been added to the database extension code for the Q-family.
The DB-FVS keyword that triggers this is InvStats. It creates two tables: 
FVS_Stats_Species and FVS_Stats_Stand.

Impact on users:This will primarily affect FVSOnline/Onlocal user's, 
allowing them to select the tables as outputs, once the Shiny code is subsequently
updated (next step).
