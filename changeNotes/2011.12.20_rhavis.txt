Subject: Species Codes

Variants affected: CS, LS, and NE

Description: FIA Codes and NRCS PLANTS Symbols were previously changed
             (see 2011.09.08_rhavis.txt). The changes could potentially
             cause problems with species mapping, so they have been
             reversed as shown in the table below.
