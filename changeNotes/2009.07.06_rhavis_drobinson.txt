Subject: Single Tree Record Cover Calculations, and Misc. Corrections
Name: R. Havis, D. Robinson
Date: July 6, 2009
Variants affected: ALL

Description:

1. The STRCLASS keyword was not producing cover values when there was only
   one tree record in the tree list. This has been corrected.

2) The logic in several routines was corrected (output not affected).

Impact on users: Users should obtain new executables.

Files:
./base/src/evmon.f - changed location of call to PPEATV such that the variable LPATV
                     is defined before used in IF statement near line 357. 
./base/src/grincr.f - corrected indexing of PRM thanks to Don Robinson, ESSA
./base/src/initre.f - deleted unneeded argument IRECNT in CALL CLIN argument list,
                      thanks to Don Robinson, ESSA
./base/src/sstage.f - corrected logic to calculate cover with only one tree record
                      is present in tree list
./base/src/svcwd.f - Complex if-then constructs failed because array bounds were
                     exceeded. This may be a compiler-specific issue and was
                     corrected by Don Robinson. ESSA. Removed unused variable LSVOBJ
./fire/base/src/fmcrowe.f - corrected indexing of DBRK, thanks to Don Robinson ESSA
./fire/base/src/fmsvsync.f - Complex if-then constructs failed because array bounds were 
                             exceeded. This may be a compiler-specific issue and was
                             corrected by Don Robinson. ESSA
