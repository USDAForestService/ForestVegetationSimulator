Subject: BM - PV Code PV Ref. Codes, IE - Tripling, NC, SO Spelling of Klamath
Name: R. Havis
Date: 20 Feb, 2009
Variants affected: BM, IE, NC and, SO 

Description:

1) The FVS Update Bulletin No. 672 describes the use of FSveg Potential
   Vegetation Codes and Reference Codes in FVS. The list of valid PV Code,
   PV Reference Code sets has been updated for the BM variant. For details,
   please contact the Forest Management Service center.
        
2) The tree record tripling logic was not working correctly for the limber pine (LM)
   and Pacific yew (PY) species in the Inland Empire variant.
   
3) The spelling of Klamath was corrected in source code comments and in forest
   code mapping reports in the main output file for the NC and SO variants.

Impact on users: Users of the BM and IE variants should obtain new executables.
                 NC and SO users may obtain new executbales at their own discretion.

Files:
./base/src/revise.f  - removed reference oo SE and OZ variants
./bm/src/pvref6.f    - incorporated PV Code PV Reference Code cross walk for R6
./ie/src/dgdriv.f    - corrected the tree index in the tripling logic for the upper and
                       lower triples for species from the CR variant
./ie/src/htgf.f      - For species 13 and 17-22 (from UT and TT variants), the height 
                       growth for triples of these tree records were not being set correctly.
                       Changed the default height growth from 0.0 to 0.1 when the SBB is
                       undefined or the diameter range gets exceeded.when the SBB was
                       undefined or the diameter range got out of bounds, height growth
                       for the triples was not being set at all.  All of these have been fixed.
