Description:
Code developed by Nick Crookston for the Climate Extension of FVS was
restructured from a single source file to a new folder, subfolders and
files to fit the FVS source code file structure and allow variant-specific
code. All Climate Extension source code at this time is considered base,
therefore; a src subfolder exists only under clim\base and other variants
have only obj subfolders. If and when variant-specific code is created,
the src subfolder for the variant(s) will be added.

1) Folder "clim" with subfolders added to the first level of the FVS source
   code file structure.

2) Climate Extension source code files added to folder clim\base\src.

3) Compile makefiles for Climate Extension base code added to clim\base\obj,
   ca\obj, cr\obj, ie\obj, and wc\obj directories.

4) fvs\bin\makefile edited for Climate Extension compile and linkage with 
   variants as stub, exclim, or included extension. Linked to variants BM,
   CA, CR, IE, NC and WC variants.


Impact on users:
No users. Climate Extension is not released.

Modified Files:
bin\makefile  - linking instructions for BM, CA, CR, IE, NC and WC variants
                with Climate Extension.
                Climate stub, exlcim, added to other link lists.

Added Files:
clim          - new folder
clim\base     - new folder
clim\base\obj - new folder
clim\base\src - new folder
