Subject: IMPLICIT NONE (CR), Event Monitor Routine, and SO Dunning codes and
         reference and location variables.
Name: R. Havis
Date: March 24, 2008
Variants affected: CA, NC, SO and WS

Description:

1. The IMPLICIT NONE statement was added to the CR variant-specific routines.

2. makefiles - Added new event monitor routine evpred.f to the compile instructions

3. In the SO variant reference location and reference age was corrected for the following species:
   WB  whitebark pine was  Breast Height Age; Base Age 50 corrected to Total Age; Base Age 100
   WL  western larch was Total Age; Base Age 100 corrected to Breast height Age; Base Age 50
   AS quaking aspen was Total Age; Base Age 100 corrected to Breast height Age; Base Age 80

   The following species were using a 50 year Dunning transformation. All of them, except aspen
   (uses 80 year base) needed to be using a 100 year Dunning transformation. 
   SP  sugar pine;  WJ  western juniper;  AF subalpine fir;  NF noble fir;  WB  whitebark pine;
   RC western redcedar;  PY Pacific yew;  WA   white alder;  RA red alder;  BM bigleaf maple;
   CW black cottonwood;  CH  bitter cherry;  WI  willow species;  GC giant chinkapin;
   MC curl-leaf mtn. mahogany; MB birchleaf mtn. mahogany; OH other hardwoods

4. The number of inventory points was added to the EchoSum (.sum) and FVSStand (.fst) output
   file headers. 

Impact on users: Users should obtain new executables.
