Description:

1) The FVS35 WARNING, shown below, will be written to the main output
   file when, on the DESIGN keyword or an input database, the number of 
   nonstockable plots equals the total number of plots and the stockability
   value is zero or blank. The stand stockable area is set to 100% to
   allow further processing.

********   FVS35 WARNING:  THE NUMBER OF NONSTOCKABLE PLOTS EQUALS THE NUMBER OF STOCKABLE PLOTS. 
                           NUMBER OF NONSTOCKABLE PLOTS SET TO ZERO.

Impact on users:

If the the number of nonstockable plots equals the total number of plots and the stockability
value is zero or blank, the run will continue with the stand stockable area set to 100%.

                      or database input data
./ls/src/estab.f - set GRDTIM as per strp/ESTAB
./metric/base/src/prtrls.f - corrected spacing in table header
