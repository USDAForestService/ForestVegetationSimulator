Subject: DataScrn Keyword Enhancement
Name: R. Haivs
Date: December 6, 2007
Variants affected: ALL

Description:

With these changes, users can screen out (or eliminate from the analysis)
trees of a given species and diameter. If they want to screen out
more than one species, then they
should create a species group containing the species to be screened,
and then specify the species group in field 3 of the DATASCRN keyword
or field 5 of the TREEDATA keyword.  Multiple DATASCRN or TREEDATA keywords
would not work when screening multiple species for obvious reasons.

Impact on users:  Users who need the enhancement to the DataScreen keyword
                  should obtain a new executable.

Files:
\base\src\initre.f   changed the date of revision
                     inserted a call to VARVER to the beginning of the routine
                     and deleted all other calls to VARVER throughout the routine
                     for efficiency
                     added field 5 to the TREEDATA keyword which is the species
                     or species group for which the diameter range applies to.
                     added field 3 of the DATASCRN keyword which is the species
                     or speices group for which the diameter range applies to.
                     added the species or species group to be screened to the
                     argument list in the calls to INTREE and DBSIN
\base\src\intree.f   changed the date of revision
                     added species to the argument list
                     added code to support adding species or species group to the
                     screening criteria
\base\src\dbsin.f    changed the date of revision
                     added species to the argument list
                     added species to the argument list in the call to INTREE

in makefiles corrected pgrprm.f77 dependency in compile instructions when needed for:
                     esadvh.f execon.f fortyp.f stkval.f svtrip.f, and brical.f
                     thanks to Steve Scharosch of Abacus for finding these makefile
                     problems.
