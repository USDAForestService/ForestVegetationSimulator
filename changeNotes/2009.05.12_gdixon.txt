Description: 1) An error trap to avoid potential alog(0) errors in the Johnson SBB
                height growth logic was rewritten so it didn't interfere with height
                growth estimates obtained from the equation (EM, SO, TT, and UT variants)
             2) The estimated bark ratio for western juniper needed to be subject to
                the bounds  .80 <= bark ratio <= 0.99 (SO variant)
             3) There is no equation for limber pine mean annual increment, so a 
                surrogate of whitebark pine was assigned (UT variant)
             4) A variable in used during calibration for some species was undefined
                and has been corrected (UT variant)
             5) Source code contained in the SO source directory is used in other
                variants. The compile and link instructions were changed to point to
                the SO33 source directory instead of the SO source directory because the
                SO33 source routines are IMPLICIT NONE compliant
             6) Height dubbing for dead trees of western juniper, whitebark pine, and
                quaking aspen in the SO variant was wrong (heights were set to a constant
                4.5 feet regardless of diameter)
             7) For species in the SO variant using surrogate equations from the WC variant,
                the dummy variable associated with a managed stand was not being set for
                establishment model trees, and the small tree diameter growth was not
                being correctly set
             8) For SO variant species other than SH, PP, or WO, height growth was not 
                correctly set for trees taller than the maximum allowed for a species


Impact on users: Users of the EM, SO, TT, and UT variants should obtain new executables.

em/src       htgf.f       changed the date of revison; revised the alog(0) error trap so it
                          doesn't interfere with intended height growth estimates   
so33/src     bratio.f     changed the date of revision; revised the code so western juniper
                          bark ratio is now bounded between 0.80 and 0.99   
so33/src     cratet.f     changed the date of revision; inserted code to bypass the call to
                          subroutine htdbh for WJ, WB, and AS
so33/src     essubh.f     changed the date of revision; moved the debug write outside the
                          select - end select block so values will print regardless of species
so33/src     htgf.f       changed the date of revison; revised the alog(0) error trap so it
                          doesn't interfere with intended height growth estimates; revised the
                          logic dealing with trees of advanced height; changed a GE test to a
                          GT test when checking against max age

                          to correctly set diameter growth for species from the WC variant

                          facilitate debugging

                          doesn't interfere with intended height growth estimates   
ut/src       cratet.f     changed the date of revison; inserted a call to subroutine AVHT40
                          to compute the variable AVH (average height of the 40 largest diameter
                          trees); added a debug write statement  
ut/src       htgf.f       changed the date of revison; revised the alog(0) error trap so it
                          doesn't interfere with intended height growth estimates ; added some
                          debug write statements in the Johnson's SBB logic  
ut/src       maical.f     changed the date of revision; changed the mean annual increment
                          equation number for limber pine from 113 (which is not recognized
                          by the mai calculation routine) to 101 whitebark pine; added a
                          debug write statement when exiting the routine
