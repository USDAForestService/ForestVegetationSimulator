Subject: Addition of Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs as a valid forest code and 
         change in which large tree diameter growth equations get used for Warm Springs for some species
Name: Gary Dixon

Variants affected: SO

Description: The Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs has three variants (EC, SO, WC) which intersect it's forest lands. None
             of these variants include a location code specifically for Warm Springs. Users were selecting, first the
             variant to use depending where on the reservation the stand was located, and second the nearest National Forest
             location code. Also, for a given location, the designated variant did not always yield the most accurate
             projection for all species (i.e. one of the other variants used on the reservation yielded lower average large tree
             diameter growth calibration values for a given species over all stands). The tribe selected the SO variant to use as 
             the designated variant for the Reservation and requested two changes: 
                 1) Develop a location code within the SO variant specifically for the Warm Springs Reservation.
                 2) When this location code is selected, use a species specific large tree diameter growth equation,
                    designated by the tribe, from one of the three currently used variants. 
                    
             note: Deschutes NF equations are used for Warm Springs for species which were not changed, and for other model
                   equations such as large and small tree height growth and small tree diameter growth.

Impact on users: Only FVS users from the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs are affected. Users may now use the SO variant
                 to model all stands on reservation lands. A location code of 799 should be entered in field 1 of the 
                 STDINFO keyword to designate the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs. Large tree diameter growth will be 
                 different for six species when a 799 code is designated. These species are: incense cedar, lodgepole pine, 
                 western redcedar, sugar pine, western white pine, and the other softwoods species group. These differences 
                 will, in turn, affect other model components such as large tree height growth.

               entered values in MAPLOC and MAPDSQ in the 10th position for Warm Springs (uses Deschutes coefficients for the
               27 species in the variant not listed above);
               added code to use the following species-specific equations when Warm Springs is selected as the location: 
               WP, SP, IC, RC all use the corresponding species equation from the WC variant, OS uses the Alaska yellow cedar
               equation from the WC variant, and LP uses the LP equation from the EC variant
