Subject: FVS_TreeList and FVS_CutList Database Output Tables
Name:  Stephanie Rebain

Description:
The FVS_CutList Database Output table was changed so that the TreeID column,
a text column, is trimmed of extra spaces.
Also, a new column was added to the FVS_Treelist and FVS_Cutlist database
tables which corresponds to the tree index column of the text-based versions 
of these tables.  The column is called TreeIndex.

Impact on users:
Because a new column has been added to the FVS_Cutlist and FVS_Treelist 
database output tables, users who created these tables with older versions
of the software will not be able to append to them using the latest version
of the software.  

Modified Files:
dbs/src/dbstrls - added a new column for tree index
dbs/src/dbscuts- trimmed the treeid to match the one in the TreeList, 
                 added a new column for tree index
