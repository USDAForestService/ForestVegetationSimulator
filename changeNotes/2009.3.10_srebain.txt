Subject: Fire and Fuels Extension Update - Southern Variant
Name:  Stephanie Rebain
Date:  03/10/2009
Variants affected: all

Description:
1)  Updates were made to the Southern Variant FFE decay rates.
The decay rates were adjusted for pine species based on a decay
study / analysis done by Philip Radtke, Virginia Tech.

2)  Cleanup was performed on some FFE files and unnecessary subroutines were deleted.
Fmsnag used to be a variant specific routine but is now a single subroutine in fire/base/src.

3) A bug in the processing of the FuelDcay keyword was fixed.

Impact on users:
Simulation runs containing pine may change slightly.  These changes are documented in the 
FFE addendum.
