Subject: Undefined variable and mixed-mode variable settings

Name: Gary Dixon

Variants affected: BM, CA, EC, NC, OC, OP, PN, SO, WC

Description: In the OP variant an undefined variable was being referenced in a debug write statement in the 
             large tree height growth model. The variable was taken out.
             In the OP, PN, and WC variants undefined variables were being referenced in debug write statements
             in the small tree height growth model. Some of these variables were also used incorrectly in
             small tree height growth calibration. These variables are now defined. 
             In all these variants, initialization values for the maximum sdi and site index arrays were
             changed from integer values to real values.

Impact on users: None.
