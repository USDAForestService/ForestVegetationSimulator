Subject: Oregon White Oak Site Index

Variants affected: PN WC

Description: Edited the PN and WC code so that if a users specifies a Oregon White Oak
             as the only site species/site index the model does not stop processing. 

Impact on users: Processing will no longer stop if a user specifies Oregon White Oak 
                 as the site species, instead it will use King's Douglas-fir Site Index
                 (base age 50) for white oak to approximate the site index for other 
                 species in the simulation and for further processing in the growth 
                 equations. There is not a known Oregon White Oak site curve, therefore
                 a user should not enter site index directly for Oregon White Oak,
                 so that a more appropriate proxy site index can be calculated from the
                 site species (see variant overview for details).
