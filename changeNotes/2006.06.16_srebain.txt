Subject: Fire and Fuels Extension Canopy Fuels Profile Output Database Table
Name:  Stephanie Rebain
Date:  06/16/2006
Variants affected: All variants with FFE (All except AK and CS)

Description:
An output database table can now be created that contains canopy fuels 
profile information.  Specific output includes the available canopy fuel 
load (lbs/acre/foot and kg/m3) at various heights above the ground (ft and m).

Users can request this report with the new FFE keyword CanFProf.

CanFProf – request the canopy fuels profile output table. 
Field 1: The FVS cycle number or the calendar year when the output starts; default is 1.
Field 2: Number of years to output; default is 200.
Field 3: Interval to ouput; default is 1 (every year).        

Because the output is sent to a database (rather than the main output file), the output 
database connection must also be set with the database extension keyword DSNOUT.

Impact on users:
This is a new feature for Fire and Fuels Extension and Database Extension users.
This keyword will be available for selection in the next version of Suppose.
Documentation on this table will be included in the next version of the
Database Extension User's Guide and the FFE addendum.
