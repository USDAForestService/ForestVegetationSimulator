Description: Corrections were made to the process of the ThinRDen option
             so that thinning from below and above will function. All
             trees within the targetted diameter range was being removed
             regardless of residual specified when thinning from below or
             above. It is important to note that since this is a relative
             density variable and target achievement will only be close,
             not exact. The reason is that the tree records individual 
             contribution to the relatived density changes with the
             population. The process for this options is controlled by
             the before thin population and individual record's contribution
             at that point in time. 

Impact on users: ThinRDen option will result in reasonable residuals
                 when thin from below or above parameter is used. The
                 option had been removing all trees in the DBH range,
                 regardless of specified residual. Thin throughout the
                 range was working just fine.

vbase\cuts.f - The calculation method in which individual tree record's
               contribution to Relatived Density for the ThinRDen option
               has been changed to use Lu, H.B. diameter and TPA factor
               method based on the factors returned by sdical.f ENTRY RDCLS.
               The target for this option was corrected to be removal as
               opposed to residual. Limit to last tree TPA contribution
               capped at ORGWK4, which is the live TPA of the tree record,
               for exit of loop near statement label 1048.
