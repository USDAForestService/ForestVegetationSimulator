Subject: TREESZCP Keyword
Name: R.Havis
Date: September 20, 2010
Variants affected: ALL

Description: The TREESZCP keyword sets morphological limits for maximum
        tree diameter and height for a given species, and specifies a minimum
        mortality rate to be used when tree diameter exceeds the specified limit.
        This minimum mortality rate was applied based on the variant standard cycle
        length, which caused an overestimation of mortality when shorter cycle
        lengths were used, and an underestimation of mortality if longer cycle
        lengths are used. This has been corrected so that TREESZCP keyword
        mortality is dynamically adjusted for the actual cycle length in a
        simulation.


Impact on users: Users of the TREESZCP keyword should obtain a new executable.
