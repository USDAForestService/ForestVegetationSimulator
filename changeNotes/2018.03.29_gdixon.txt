Subject: General FVS code modernization
Name: Gary Dixon
Date: 03/29/2018
Variants affected: All

Description: As part of a code modernization effort, the FVS code is being cleaned up and streamlined. The
             following changes are to eliminate compile warning messages. Changes included in this group are: 
                  1) elimination of mixed-mode variable settings
                  2) elimination of tab characters
                  3) elimination of unused statement labels
                  4) elimination of unused declared local variables and arrays
                  5) correction of mismatched character arrays and variables
                  6) elimination of unused dummy argument warnings
             
             Miscellaneous other corrections were made that pertained to uninitialized variables and other problems 
             that were causing denormal run-time errors. Some inconsistencies in the test keyword files and sum.save
             files were corrected.
