Subject: General FVS code modernization
Name: Gary Dixon
Date: 03/29/2018
Variants affected: All

Description: As part of a code modernization effort, the FVS code is being cleaned up and streamlined. The
             following changes are to eliminate compile warning messages. Changes included in this group are: 
                  1) elimination of mixed-mode variable settings
                  2) elimination of tab characters
                  3) elimination of unused statement labels
                  4) elimination of unused declared local variables and arrays
                  5) correction of miss-matched character arrays and variables
                  6) elimination of unused dummy argument warnings
             
             Miscellaneous other corrections were made that pertained to uninitialized variables and other problems 
             that were causing denormal run-time errors. Some inconsistencies in the test keyword files and sum.save
             files were corrected.
