Subject: SQLite treelist database output. 
Name: Nick Crookston
Date: May 13, 2019
Variants affected: All

Description: Dead trees in the input treedata were not getting handled completely
             in the output to database process for treelists. Modifications in 3
             SQLite specific routines handling the standard treelist, cutlist and
             after treatment treelist were updated to resolve the issue.

Impact on users: This pertains to Q-Family of executables only. Users processing
                 input data with dead trees and requesting ouput treelists be
                 sent to database will not experience failures.
