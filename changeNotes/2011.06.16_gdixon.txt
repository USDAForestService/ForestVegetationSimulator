Variants affected: Inland Empire (IE)

Description: The effect of CCF on predicted large tree diameter growth for
             limber pine and Pacific yew was being applied twice.The error
             resulted in a slight underprediction of diameter growth for
             these two species. This has been corrected. 

Impact on users: Users of the IE variant should obtain a new executable.
