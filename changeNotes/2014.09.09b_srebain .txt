Subject: FFE Bug Fix
Name:  Stephanie Rebain
Date:  09/09/2014
Variants affected: All

Description:

1)  The FFE Canopy Fuels Profile database output table (FFE keyword CANFPROF) was erroneously printing two
sets of output during years with simulated fires.  This has been corrected.

Modified Files:
fire/base/src/fmpocr.f - added variable ICALL to set when the canopy fuels profile table is output
fire/base/src/fmcfmd2.f - changed call to fmpocr to eliminate unnecessary repeated calculations
fire/base/src/fmmain.f - added call to fmpocr to print canopy fuels after burning
