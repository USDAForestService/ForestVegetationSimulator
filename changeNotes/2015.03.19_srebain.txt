Description:

1)  Errors with the canopy fuels calculations used to estimate canopy base height
    and canopy bulk density were corrected.

Impact on users:
Canopy base height and canopy bulk density values (and fire behavior and fire effects metrics as a result) 
may be different.

Modified Files:
fire/base/src/fmpocr.f - edited the canopy fuels calculations used to estimate
                         canopy base height and canopy bulk density.  Specifically,
                         adjusted the amount in the top and bottom 1-foot section for 
                         each tree based on the proportional coverage of the crown in
                         that 1-foot section so that the individual crown biomass 
                         sections adds up to the correct total.  Also, when the 
                         weibull distribution is used, a check was made to make
                         sure the top of the distribution is at the correct spot.  Also,
                         the max height was changed from 200 to 400.
dbs/src/dbsfmcanpr.f - changed the max height from 200 to 400.
