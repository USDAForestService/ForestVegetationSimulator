Description: The gfortran compiler flagged some problems in the code. The
             corrections are described below.

Impact on users: None

Files:

./bin/makefile - removed SMDGF object (in SO_LINK) from SO variant object list
./bin/FC.make - corrected case in db_compile_so command
./fire/ca/src/fmcfmd.f - corrected character declaration statement
./mistoe/obj/makefile removed compile of MISINTBM, MISINTEM, MISINTSO, and MISINTTT;
                      these routines are variant specific and are compiled in the
                      variant directories.
./so/obj/makefile - removed compile of SMDGF
./so/src/regent.f - copied calculation of small tree diameter growth from em/SMDGF
                    for species 16 whitebark pine; it was incorrect to access this
                    equation by linking in em/SMDGF because the species array dimensions
                    do not match.
