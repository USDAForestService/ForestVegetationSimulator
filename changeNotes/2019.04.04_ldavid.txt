Description: ThinCC triggered underflow error in sdical.f entry point cccls
             EXP function and a limit of 86 was placed on the parameter to
             correspond with the limit of a single precision real variable.

             Q-family only - User needs exceeded the size of the allocated SQL
             statement length for the DB output FVS_Compute table, SQL statement
             length was  increased from 2,000 to 10,000 characters which is the
             max length implemented in the ODBC version. This will enable the
             creation and population of a FVS_Compute table of approximately 500
             columns.

Impact on users: Compute table output and ThinCC errors averted
                 
Files:

dbsqlite\dbscmpu.f - Maximum SQL statement length increased to 10,000 characters.
vbase\sdical.f     - ENTRY CCCLS has limit of 86 on EXP parameter value.
