Variants affected: 1) TT
                   2) All variants

Description: 1) At the request of R4, the TT variant was expanded from 8 to 18
             species. Equations and coefficients for the additional species
             are from the Utah, Central Rockies, Inland Empire, and South Central  
             Oregon / Northeast California variants. The expanded species list and 
             surrogate equations are as follows:

C     1 = WHITEBARK PINE               WB  PINUS ALBICAULIS
C     2 = LIMBER PINE                  LM  PINUS FLEXILIS
C     3 = DOUGLAS-FIR                  DF  PSEUDOTSUGA MENZIESII
C     4 = SINGLELEAF PINYON            PM  PINUS MONOPHYLLA
C     5 = BLUE SPRUCE                  BS  PICEA PUNGENS    
C     6 = QUAKING ASPEN                AS  POPULUS TREMULOIDES
C     7 = LODGEPOLE PINE               LP  PINUS CONTORTA
C     8 = ENGELMANN SPRUCE             ES  PICEA ENGELMANNII
C     9 = SUBALPINE FIR                AF  ABIES LASIOCARPA
C    10 = PONDEROSA PINE               PP  PINUS PONDEROSA
C    11 = UTAH JUNIPER                 UJ  JUNIPERUS OSTEOSPERMA
C    12 = ROCKY MOUNTAIN JUNIPER       RM  JUNIPERUS SCOPULORUM
C    13 = BIGTOOTH MAPLE               BI  ACER GRANDIDENTATUM    
C    14 = ROCKY MOUNTAIN MAPLE         MM  ACER GLABRUM      
C    15 = NARROWLEAF COTTONWOOD        NC  POPULUS ANGUSTIFOLIA
C    16 = CURLLEAF MOUNTAIN-MAHOGANY   MC  CERCOCARPUS LEDIFOLIUS
C    17 = OTHER SOFTWOODS              OS
C    18 = OTHER HARDWOODS              OH

C VARIANT EXPANSION:
C BS USES ES EQUATIONS FROM TT
C PM USES PI (COMMON PINYON) EQUATIONS FROM UT
C PP USES PP EQUATIONS FROM CI
C UJ AND RM USE WJ (WESTERN JUNIPER) EQUATIONS FROM UT
C BI USES BM (BIGLEAF MAPLE) EQUATIONS FROM SO
C MM USES MM EQUATIONS FROM IE
C NC AND OH USE NC (NARROWLEAF COTTONWOOD) EQUATIONS FROM CR
C MC USES MC (CURL-LEAF MTN-MAHOGANY) EQUATIONS FROM SO
C OS USES OT (OTHER SP.) EQUATIONS FROM TT

This expansion includes components associated with FVStt.exe (base model, partial
regeneration establishment model, cover, dwarf mistletoe, econ, and ffe). It does
not include additional components associated with FVSttx.exe (Douglas-fir beetle,
Douglas-fir tussock moth, mountain pine beetle, root disease, and budworm).

2) A potential problem with PPE runs was discovered and fixed.
   The COMMON block FVSSTDCM was moved from within the FVSSTD routine to the /common
   source code directory. The FVSSTD routine was modified accordingly. Variables
   contained within the FSSSTDCM common block were added to the /ppbase/src GETSTD 
   and PUTSTD routines which are used in the PPE extension.  This change affects all
   variants.

Impact on users: 1) Users of the TT variant should obtain a new executable and a new variant 
                 overview document.  Results for projections of the original 8 species 
in this variant may be slightly different due to miscellaneous error corrections
or updated equations and site index ranges. Results reported as the original "other" (OT) 
species may be different due to some of the trees that may have been in this grouping 
originally may be reported as a different species now (e.g. other hardwoods). 

One major impact on users is that all site index values should now be entered on
the site curves base-age basis. In the previous version of this variant, most site
index values were on a 50-year age basis regardless of the site curves base age.
This means that any SITECODE keywords in existing runstreams need to be changed so
the site index value corresponds to the site curves base-age for that species.

2) Anyone using the Parallel Processing Extension should obtain a new executable.
