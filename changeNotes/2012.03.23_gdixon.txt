Variants affected: Central Idaho (CI), Inland Empire (IE), Tetons (TT)

Description: The small tree model is used to grow regeneration from the time it is
             greater than 5 years old to the end of the projection cycle. When regeneration
             occurred in cycles where the cycle length was 5 years, a run-time error was
             being generated. This has been corrected.
             

Impact on users: Users of these variants should obtain a new executable.

Files:
ci,ie,tt/src   regent.f  changed the date of revision; initialized the value of SCALE2 to 1;
                   made the calculation of the SCALE2 variable dependent on the value of LSKIPH
