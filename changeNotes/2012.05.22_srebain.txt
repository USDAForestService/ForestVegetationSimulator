Subject: Fire and Fuels Extension Update

Variants affected: All

Description:

1) FVS users can initialize their surface fuel loading by selecting a fuels photo series reference and code.
The logic used to read in and interpret the codes was improved.  The valid codes for some photo series references (16, 29, and 30)
were changed to match those used in the FSVEG database.
 
Impact on users:
Users of the FuelFoto keyword or who set photo series codes in their input database should obtain new executables.  Users with old
simulation files where fuels photo references 16, 29, or 30 were used will have to update their files to use the latest codes.  Fuels
photoseries reference codes and photo codes can be found in the FFE guide, Appendix D, posted here:

Modified Files:

fire/base/src/fmphotoval.f - fixed photocodes in comments
fire/base/src/fmphotocode.f - fixed one photocode that had a typo;  added logic to strip off any dashes when searching
                              for a matching code to prevent dash mismatch errors; changed valid codes for references 16, 29, and 30.
