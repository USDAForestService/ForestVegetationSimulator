Subject: Miscellaneous changes in CS and LS variants
Name: Lance David
Date: 10/13/2017
Variants affected: CS and LS

Description: With the implementation of new diameter growth equations (dgf.f)
in CS and LS variants, run time floating-point exception errors occurred when
processing test dataset from flat file input. Errors did not occur when an input
database was used. It is important to note that the crash did not happen in 
dgf.f, but in return from dgdriv.f to cratet.f, which makes no sense. During 
process to resolve, some subroutines were modified, but only with initialization
of variables and debug accommodation. No procedural or functional changes where
made that changed results of projections. In the end, the only way to alleviate
the floating-point exception, which I currently believe to be a false detection,
was to remove the option from the compiler.


Impact on users: Projections will be different for the CS and LS variants due to
the new diameter growth equations (dgf.f) previously committed. These changes
do alter projections at all. 

Files:
/cs/src/findag.f           Initialized AGET and HTMAX variables, added debug.
/ls/src/findag.f

/cs/src/dgf.f              Removed tab characters and unused declared variables.
/ls/src/dgf.f              Formatted data blocks and moved from bottom of routine
                           to the top.

/ls/src/dgdriv.f           Added debug. Impelemented common exit point at end of 
                           subroutine.

/ls/src/regent.f           initialized variables AGET and D used in call parameters.

/ls/src/htcalc.f           Added debug. Set variable HTG1 = 0.0 at line 396

/dbs/src/dbsstandin.f      Initialize variable CHAB to blank.
