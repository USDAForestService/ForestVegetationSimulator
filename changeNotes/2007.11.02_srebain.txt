Subject:  Database Extension - Treelist Output Correction
Name: Stephanie Rebain	
Date: 11/02/2007
Variants affected: All

Description:
1) Dead trees present in the initial inventory were being printed to the text-based
treelist, but were not being included when the treelist was exported to Excel or
Access using the Database Extension.  Also, the diameter growth values being
exported with the Database Extension treelist did not correctly reflect the option chosen
on the TREELIST keyword (field 7).  Both of these were corrected.

Impact on users:
This change affects treelist output exported using the Database Extension.  Users of this
report should obtain new executables.
