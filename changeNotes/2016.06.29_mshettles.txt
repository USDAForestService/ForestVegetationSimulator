Description: The calculated maximum diameter growth bound (DGMAX) was scaled so as 
to be congruent with the timescale of DDS. DGMAX was being calculated based upon 
the default of 10 years, whereas DDS is scaled based upon user defined time scales. 
Differences in scaled diameter growth for larger trees were being nullified as a result.
This difference was reconciled. 

Impact on users: Diameter growth predicted for larger trees may change to be larger 
than with previous executables for these three variants.
