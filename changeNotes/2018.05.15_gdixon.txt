Subject: Directory structure changes

Variants affected: All variants

Description: These changes are part of a code modernization effort undertaken by the Forest Management Service
             Center and follow guidelines suggested in the "FVS Code Modernization: Considerations and
             Recommendations" (Gary Dixon, Final Report, 05/25/2017). Changes included in this bulletin are
             to improve the code repository directory structure, eliminate unused or obsolete subroutines, and
             make the source list files more intuitive and easier to work with.

             Specifically:
             1. Source list files were reorganized into logical groups.
             2. An archive subdirectory was created for obsolete code.
             3. The ni/src subdirectory was eliminated (moved to the archive section). Subroutines within
                this subdirectory that were still used were copied to an appropiate place in the remaining
                directory structure and the source list files modified accordingly.
             4. The fire/ni/src subdirectory was eliminated (moved to the archive section). Subroutines within
                this subdirectory that were still used were copied to an appropiate place in the remaining
                directory structure and the source list files modified accordingly.
             5. The fire/kt/src subdirectory was created to hold fire subroutines specific to the KT variant.
             6. The bgc/src subdirectory was eliminated (moved to the archive section).
             7. The /oz subdirectory was eliminated (moved to the archive section).

Impact on users: These changes only affect FVS developers; there is no impact on users.

                        extensions. Variant-specific files are listed first in each of these sections.
