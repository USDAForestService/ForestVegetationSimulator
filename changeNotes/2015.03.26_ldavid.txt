Description: Western Root Disease model modified to use the General Report
             Writer facility and to send output disease summary and reports
             (summary, detailed, and bark beetle mortality) to a output
             database. A correction was made to the bark beetle mortality
             report where stand level TPA mortality was not properly weighted
             to represent diseased stand area and uninfected stand area as a
             total stand area mortality TPA value.
             
             This update includes the addition of three new Database Extension
             keywords: RDSum, RDBBMort, RDDetail.

             Root disease summary and bark beetle mortality reports used to
             have options to generate seperate external text files. The option
             to send these reports directly to the output database has replaced
             capability.

Impact on users: Additional output options and corrected value in the 
                 bark beetle mortality report.

Files:

rd\src\

rdbout.f    - added calls to GETID and GETLUN. Added report ID to write 
              and format statements for RD bark beetle mortality report.
            - added call to DBSRD3 to write output to database.
            - Summation for TOTSPC corrected to properly weight inside
              and outside disease area values for total stand representation.
            - Auxiliary flat file from BBOUT keyword no longer available. This
              report now available in output DB.
