Variants affected: AK

Description:

1) Volume equations were not being correctly mapped to species.
the same volume equation, the Eq. for the first species in
the tree list, was used for all species in the stand. This problem
was introduced during the update that converted the Tongass N.F.
to the Flewelling volume Eqs. (FVS Update Bulletin No. 596)
and has has been corrected.

2) Volume equations for the Chugach National Forest were not being
used by default. This has been corrected.

3) The volume equation developed for white spruce (Larsen and Winterberger.
PNW-RN-478) was added for use by all National Forests in R10.
              

The equation numbers used in the AK variant are summarized below.

Files:
ak/src/blkdat.f - added Chugach NF forest code to IFORCD array,
                  and mapped to 1 in IFORST array
ak/src/forkod.f - added code to retain Chugach KODFOR value 1004
                  modified text written to main output file
ak/src/varvol.f - added white spruce volume Eq. No. to Tongass
                  and and Chugach NFs and corrected volume Eq.
                  assignment to species logic. Removed default
                  mapping of Chugach to Tongass Eq. Nos.
base/src/revise.f
bin/makefile - added r10d2h to AK link list
