Variants affected: Eastern Montana (EM)

Description: Insect and disease extensions were updated for the new 19 species
             Eastern Montana variant. The Dwarf Mistletoe Model was already
             done by Gary Dixon. The Douglas-fir Tussock Moth, Lodgepole MPB,
             Western Root Disease and General Defoliation models' variant-
             specific subroutines were modified or created to make them
             operational.

Impact on users: All I&D models that were available with the 11 species version
                 are now available with the 19 species EM variant.
