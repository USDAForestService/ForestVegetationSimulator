Description:

1) All variants: The PARMS option using the FRETILIZ keyword was not
                 working correctly when using non-default values for
                 field 5, the multiplier for modifying the predicted
                 response. This has been corrected.


Impact on users:

Field 5 of the FRETILIZ keyword, the multiplier for modifying the predicted
response, may be adjusted using the PARMS option.
