Subject:  Additional FFE tables available for use with the Database Extension to FVS
Name: Stephanie Rebain	
Date: 12/20/2004
Variants affected:
all variants with FFE (all variants except LS, NE, CS, and AK)

Description:
Five FFE output tables were added to the Database Extension.  User's can now output
the Fuel Consumption Report, Burn Conditions Report, Mortality Report, Summary 
Snag Report, and Detailed Snag Report directly to a database.  Five additional
database keywords were created to do this (FuelRept, BurnRept, MortRept, SnagSum,
and SnagOut).  
 
      NEW DATABASE EXTENSION KEYWORDS

      FuelRept 
      field 1: 1 = both database and standard output are requested
               2 = database output only
               (default is 1)

      BurnRept 
      field 1: 1 = both database and standard output are requested
               2 = database output only
               (default is 1)

      MortRept 
      field 1: 1 = both database and standard output are requested
               2 = database output only
               (default is 1)
      
      SnagSum 
      field 1: 1 = both database and standard output are requested
               2 = database output only
               (default is 1)

      SnagOut 
      field 1: 1 = both database and standard output are requested
               2 = database output only
               (default is 1)                              

See the User's Guide to the Database Extension of FVS for more details.

Impact on users:
This change will not change FVS output.  It simply provides users with additional capabilities.
The new database keywords will be available for selection in Suppose in the next Suppose update.
