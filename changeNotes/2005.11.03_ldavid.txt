Description:

wwpb/src/bmkill.f   To eliminate a problem of non-host trees beeing labeled
                    WWPB mortality by SVMORT subroutine, added new array (BTKL)
                    that holds mortality for WWPB host trees only. Detail of
                    significance here is that mortality currently held in 
                    WK2 array that has not already been submitted to SVMORT
                    will be credited to WWPB.

base/src/svnad.f    In order to uniquely portray WWPBM beetle-killed trees
         svnage.f   in SVS, SVS tree class codes 90, 91 and 92 are used. The
         svout.f    original plan to use 80-series codes had to be abandoned
                    because class codes less than 90 are not recognized as dead
                    by SVS in the generation of charts and graphs. This was
                    recommended by Bob McGaughey (SVS author) as modification
                    to SVS is not a option at this time.
