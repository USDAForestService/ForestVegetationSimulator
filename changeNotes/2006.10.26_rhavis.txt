Description: Three variables were recently added to the FvsStand post processor
             output, normal tree height, tree age, and original inventory point
             number (please refer to FVS Update Bulletin No. 647). These variables
             were also added to the output for dead trees listed in the input data.

Impact on users: Users having dead trees in the input data and who wish to use the
                 FvsStand post processor should obtain new execuables to prevent
                 post processor run time errors.
