Subject: FVS_Treelist_East table.

Name: Nick Crookston

Variants affected: NE, SN, LS, and CS

Description: Three columns in the standard treelist output for these variants
are different than the other variants. For these variants new database output
tables are created called: FVS_Treelist_East, FVS_ATRTList_East, and 
FVS_CutList_East. The difference between these tables and the corresponding
tables from the other variants is that column names change from: 
TCuFt, MCuFt, BdFt to MCuFt, SCuFt, SBdFt.

This change is only done in the dbsqlite code. In the process a slight change
is made to the code that creates the FVS_Cases table for all variants (no format
change.

Impact on users: User's of these variants will see the _East suffix on the treelist
datatables and the tables will have three different column names.
