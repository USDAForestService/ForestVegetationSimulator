Subject: Bole Height to Merch. Top - Ht2TDib output
Name: R. Havis
Date: November 9, 2007
Variants affected: All except R9

Description: A new output column (Ht2TDib) was added to the cutlist data base
             table, showing the bole length from stump to top inside bark
             diameter Merch. Spec. These bole lengths are only available through
             volume equations identified as Profile Models (except the Rustagi
             Profile Model) in the measurements handbook - Volume Equation Numbers
             http://www.fs.fed.us/fmsc/measure/handbooks/index.shtml

Impact on users: Users should obtain a new executable if the output is needed.

Files:

VARVOL - The ARRAYS.F77 include file was added to the VARVOL routines and the Ht2TDib
variable was set.
MAKEFILES - the ARRAYS.F77 file dependency was added to the VARVOL compile instructions.
