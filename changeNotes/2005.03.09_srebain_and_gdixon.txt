Subject: Fix to the Cover Extension 
Name: Stephanie Rebain and Gary Dixon
Date: March 9, 2005
Variants affected: All variants with Cover

Description: 
The Cover extension was using incorrect (previous cycle) crown width 
values in its calculations.  This was fixed.  The Cover extension now 
yields canopy cover estimates that match those on the structure class table
and those reported via SPMCDBH.

Impact on users:
This should have no effect on base FVS or FFE output.  This will affect
Cover extension output.
