Subject: Change Dashes to Blanks and Misc. Updates
Name: R. Havis
Date: February 16, 2012
Variants affected: Southern

Description: The Southern variant default setting for writing the ALPHA SPECIES - FIA CODE
             CROSS REFERENCE Table in the main output file was changed from true to false.
             DEBUG functionality was commented out of the CWCALC routine. Dashes were
             used in some arrays (JSP, FIAJSP, and PLNJSP) and these potentially cause
             processing problems in some systems. The dashes were changed to spaces where
             needed. Other minor updates are indicated below.
             
Impact on users: The ALPHA SPECIES - FIA CODE CROSS REFERENCE Table will not be written
                 by default in the Southern variant.
