Subject: Fire and Fuels Extension Update - Usage of Kodtyp vs. Itype
Name:  Stephanie Rebain
Date:  02/29/2008
Variants affected: all FFE variants

Description:
Most FFE subroutines were updated to use itype instead of kodtyp whenever
plant association or habitat type is used to set default fuel loading, select
a fuel model, or affect other parts of FFE, such as the snag dynamics.  Other
corrections were made as small errors were found.

Impact on users:
Most users will see no difference in output as a result of these changes.
Some cases where there may be an output difference include:
NI/IE simulations with a forest location code of 621 (Colville NF)
Simulations where all trees are cut in the first cycle (NC, CA, CR, TT variants)
SO simulations
