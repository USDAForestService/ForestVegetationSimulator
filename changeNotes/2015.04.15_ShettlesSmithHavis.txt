Subject: BLM Forest Codes, Volume Equations
Name: M. Shettles, E. Smith-Meteja, R. Havis
Date: April 15, 2015
Variants affected: Western Variants Except WS

Description:

1. CA variant: The following BLM codes were added to the CA variant, 710-Rosenburg,
   711-Medford, and 712-Coos Bay. Growth relationships for Siskiyou NF
   were mapped to Coos Bay. Growth relationships for the Rogue River NF
   were mapped to Rosenburg and Medford.

2. Western variants except WS: Volume equation numbers in the Cruise software were
   reconciled with the volume equation numbers used in FVS. See variant
   overviews for specific volume equation numbers and form-class values.

Impact on users: Users should obtain new executables. Volumes will be different
                 if volume equation numbers have changed for species in the
                 simulation.
