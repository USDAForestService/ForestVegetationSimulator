Description: Douglas-fir Beetle, Douglas-fir Tussock Moth, Lodgepole MPB model,
             Western Root Disease, and Western Spruce Budworm models modified 
             for the TT expansion to 18 species. The Dwarf Mistletoe model
             was modified my Gary Dixon during his expansion of TT base FVS.


Impact on users: There are some changes in the bahavior and impact of insect and 
                 and pathogen extensions do to the inclusion of new tree species
                 and other changes to base FVS associated with the tree species
                 expansion. Please refer to Gary Dixon's change notes 
                 2010.06.18_gdixon.txt for details of base FVS changes.

The following files changed to accomodate the species expansion:

/mistoe/src  misinttt.f - code update made by Gary Dixon

/dfb/src     dfblkdtt.f - code update

/dftm/src    tminittt.f - code update

/lpmpb/src   mpblkdtt.f - new file. Before expansion, code was shared from other variant.

/rd/src      rdintt.f - new file. Before expansion, code was shared from other variant.
             rdblkdtt.f - code update

/wsbwe/src   bwebktt.f - code update
             bwebmstt.f - new file. Before expansion, code was shared from other variant.

/tt/obj      makefile - added new files (mpblkdtt.f,  bwebmstt.f) to respective object lists and compile instructions.

/bin         makefile - created new FVSttx link list that includes new LPMPB and WSB variant-specific files
