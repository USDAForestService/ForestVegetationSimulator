Subject:  New FFE Event Monitor Functions
Name: Stephanie Rebain	
Date: 12/08/2004
Variants affected:
all variants with FFE (all variants except LS, NE, CS, and AK)

Description:
Three new FFE event monitor functions were created.  

PotFMort(arg1) returns potential fire mortality.
arg1 = 1 returns potential severe fire mortality in terms of % BA
arg1 = 2 returns potential moderate fire mortality in terms of % BA
arg1 = 3 returns potential severe fire mortality in terms of cuft vol/acre
arg1 = 4 returns potential moderate fire mortality in terms of cuft vol/acre

FuelMods(arg1, arg2) returns the fuel models being used and their associated weights.
arg1 can equal 1, 2, 3, or 4 and signals which of the four fuel models/weights to return.
arg2 = 1 returns the actual fuel model number
arg2 = 2 returns the weight

SalvVol(arg1, arg2, arg3) returns the salvage volume removed in total cuft/acre.
arg1 = species (0 for all)
arg2 = min dbh value for the calculation
arg3 = max dbh value for the calculation 
If multiple salvage operations are scheduled for a given cycle, SalvVol returns the
cumulative volume.


Impact on users:
The only change in output should be in the snag summary and detailed snag reports.
In previous versions, these reports were output before salvage operations in a given year.
In new versions, these reports are output after salvage operations in a given year.
Also, salvage operations can now only occur at the beginning of a cycle.  In previous
versions, salvage operations could be scheduled in any year.  Now if a salvage is scheduled
mid-cycle, it will be done at the beginning of the cycle (much like the way the thinning
keywords work).

These functions are currently available for use in FVS.  They will be included in the next
update of the Suppose interface.

Files:
fire/base/common/fmfcom.f77 - added 2 new variables, potkil and potvol, that represent
                              potential fire mortality.
fire/base/common/fmcom.f77  - added a new variable, salvspa, that tracks the salvaged snags per
                              acre for each snag record.
base/src/algkey.f - added the three new em functions, potfmort, salvvol, and fuelmods.
base/src/evldx.f -  added code for the three new functions.
base/src/algevl.f - added the three new em functions, potfmort, salvvol, and fuelmods.
fire/base/src/fminit.f - initialized potkil, potvol, and salvspa to 0.
fire/base/src/fmpofl.f - set potvol and potkil.
fire/base/src/fmevmon.f - added three entry points (fmevsal, fmevmrt, fmevfmd) for the three
                          new em functions.
fire/base/src/fmmain.f - removed the call to fmsalv, so that it is not called each year.
                         Also reset cwdcut to 0 in all years except the first of a cycle to
                         prevent incorrect amounts of fuel from being left on the ground.
fire/base/src/fmsdit.f - added a call to fmsalv, so that it is done each cyle, rather than each year.
fire/base/src/fmsalv.f - initialized salvspa to 0 and set salvspa based on salvage
                         operations each cycle.  Also changed it so that all salvage
                         keywords for a given cycle are processed at the beginning of
                         the cycle.
fire/ppe/src/fmppget.f - added the new common variables (potkil, potvol, and salvspa)
fire/ppe/src/fmppput.f - added the new common variables (potkil, potvol, and salvspa)
