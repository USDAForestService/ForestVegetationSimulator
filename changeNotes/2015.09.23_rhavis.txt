Description: Changed the keyword Flags controlling the SPLeave keyword. Also,
             changed the SPLeave keyword echo from set T/F by variable to
             set by logic around write statements and using different
             format statements.

             The Flags (field 3) are now as follows:
             
             Flag <= 0 the species leave-status is False, species is eligible for harvesting
             Flag >  0 the species leave-status is True
