Variants affected: ALL

Description:
1) The Event Monitor (EM) variables DBA (also DBA%) and DCCF (also DCCF%)
   are were not functioning as described in the FVS model documentation.
   THe variables were using after-thin information rather than before-thin,
   start-of-cycle conditions. This has been corrected so the EM variables
   function precisely as stated in the documentation. This problem was
   identified and corrected by Don Robinson, ESSA Technologies Ltd.
   
EM Variable
DBA        Basal area per acre at the beginning of current cycle minus the basal
           area at the beginning of the previous cycle.
DBA%       Basal area per acre at the beginning of current cycle divided by the
           basal area at the beginning of the previous cycle; then multiplied
           times 100
DCCF       Crown competition factor at the beginning of the current cycle minus
           the factor at the beginning of the previous cycle
DCCF%      Crown competition factor at the beginning of the current cycle divided
           by the factor at the beginning of the previous cycle; then multiplied
           times 100

2) Updates were made to eliminate output tables that were repetitive or
   unnecessary. Treelist or cutlist table requests that are exact duplicates
   of previous requests within a cycle are ignored. Also, the plot habitat type
   summary tables are no longer printed to the main output file from variants
   running the partial establishment model (BM, CA, CR, CS, EC, LS, NC, NE, PN,
   SE, SN, SO, TT, UT, WC, and WS. 

3) The CI variant runs the full establishment model, and will automatically add
   regeneration species to the tree list when model conditions are appropriate.
   The western larch species has been added to the list of naturally regenerating
   species for the Boise National Forest in the CI variant.

4) Species codes in the input tree list that were in lower case alpha format
   were not being recognized. This has been corrected.

Impact on users: All users should obtain new executables.

Files:
./base/src/evtstv.f  - replaced the IOSUM BA variable with *IOLDBA* from the prior
                       cycle and the IOSUM CCF variable with *IBTCCF* from the prior cycle.
./base/src/intree.f  - added call to UPCASE
./base/src/prtrls.f  - added logic to ignore treelist of cutlist requests which are exact
                       duplicates of previous requests within a given cycle
./base/src/revise.f
./base/src/sumout.f  - updated comments
./ci/src/blkdat.f    - Initiated probability of western larch occurring as natural regen on the
                       Boise NF
./strp/src/estab.f   - removed priingting ot the plot habitat type summary tables to the main output
                       file
./ls_new/src/estab.f - removed priingting ot the plot habitat type summary tables to the main output
                       file
