Subject: Correct Height Dubbing when No Input Crown Ratio
Name: R. Havis, Yingfang Wang
Date: May 18, 2007
Variants affected: AK, BM, EC and SO

Description: Assigning missing heights to input data is performed before assigning missing crown
             ratios. Therefore, missing crown ratios are estimated at 50% or a crown class of 5
             when needed for height calculations. An error caused missing crown class to be 
             estimated as 1 rather than 5, This has been corrected. The error affected all species,
             except sequence numbers 10 and 11 (RA and CW) in the AK variant, species sequance
             numbers 1-8, 10, 12, 13 and 32 (WP, SP, DF, WF, MH, IC, LP, ES, PP, GF, AF, and OS)
             in the SO variant, and small ponderosa pine (D<3. in) in the BM and EC variants.
             Thanks are extended to Yingfang Wang for finding this error.
             
Impact on users: Users should obtain new executables.

./so/src/cratet.f    moved crown dubbing to before height dubbing, previously crown dubbing was
                     ineffective in setting JCR for height dubbing calculations.
