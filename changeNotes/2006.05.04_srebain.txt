Description:
A new soil heating report is available when fires are simulated with the
Fire and Fuels Extension.  This soil heating output uses the soil heating
algorithms already in the FOFEM model.  Output includes the temperature (°C)
at various depths below the surface.  Also output is the depth where the
temperature exceeds 60 °C (often considered the lethal temperature for 
living organisms) and 275 °C.

Users can request this report with the new FFE keyword SOILHEAT.

SOILHEAT – request the soil heating report when a fire is simulated.
Field 1: The FVS cycle number or the calendar year when the output starts; 
         default is 1.
Field 2: Number of years to output; default is 200.
Field 3: Soil Type – 1 (Loamy Skeletal), 2 (Fine Silt), 3 (Fine), 
                     4 (Coarse Silt), or 5 (Coarse Loam)

Impact on users:
This is a new feature for FFE users.
This keyword will be available for selection in the next version of Suppose.

Modified Files:
fire/base/src/fmsoilheat.f - made some corrections so that soil type is 
                             read in and soil moisture is estimated correctly.
fire/base/src/fmburn.f - adding the processing of the SoilHeat keyword
fire/base/src/fmfout.f - deleted the processing of the SoilHeat keyword
fire/base/src/fmin.f - added a field to the SoilHeat keyword for soil type
fire/base/common/FMFCOM.F77 - added a new variable for soil type, SOILTP
fire/base/src/fminit.f - initialized SOILTP to 3 (Fine)
fire/ppe/src/fmppput.f - added SOILTP
fire/ppe/src/fmppget.f - added SOILTP
