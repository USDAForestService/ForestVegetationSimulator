Variants affected: WS, CA, NC, SO

Description:
Region 5 users may enter a Region 5 site class code, which is mapped to a certain
site index value.  Originally only codes 0 - 5 were accepted, but this was expanded
to include site classes 6 and 7.  Also, the site index assignments for each site
class were modified to match other Region 5 applications as follows:

Region 5      50-year      100-year
site class   site index   site index
0                106         140
1                90          121
2                75          102
3                56          81
4                49          67
5                39          54
6                31          44
7                23          36

Impact on users: Users in Region 5 will notice output differences and should
obtain new executables.
