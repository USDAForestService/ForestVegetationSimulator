Subject: Miscellaneous Code Updates
Name: R. Havis
Date: December 11, 2006
Variants affected: ALL

Description:
1) Corrected species mapping of unrecognized FIA codes in SO33 variant. Unknown species
   codes were always mapped to other hardwoods (OH). This was changed such that when
   an unrecognized FIA code is less than 300, it is mapped to other softwoods (OS)
   otherwise it is mapped to other hardwoods (OH)
   
2) The FVS Stand report, output format for the inventory point ID was increased to
   accommodate the length of the output variable.
   
3) The FFE PPE code was updated to pass the Carbon Report variables needed
   for the PPE.

Impact on users: Users of the Sornec variant should obtain a new executable.

Files:
./base/src/fvsstd.f - increased formatted field width of input variable IPVEC
./base/src/revise.f
./fire/ppe/src/fmppget.f - added carbon variables
./fire/ppe/src/fmppput.f - added carbon variables
./ni/src/spctrn.f - modified logic for SO variant to assign softwood FIA codes
                    to OS category rather than all unrecognized FIA codes going to
                    OH category
./wwpb/src/bmslsh.f - corrected potential array out of bounds error
