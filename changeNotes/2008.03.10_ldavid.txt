Subject: Dwarf Mistletoe reports in PPE
Name: Lance R. David
Date: March 10, 2008
Variants affected: All western variants

Description:
Several report generation controlling variables were relocated to the
MISCOM common block and became stand-specific variables in PPE (added
to the put and get routines). This resolves a newly discovered issue
in PPE simulations where the top 4 most dwarf mistletoe infected species
were reselected during the simulation causing the table headings not to
match the values in the columns.

Stand level summaries were unaffected and single stand simulations were also
unaffected.

Impact on users: Western variant PPE users should obtain new executables
