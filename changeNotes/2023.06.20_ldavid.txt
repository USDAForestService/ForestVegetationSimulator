Subject: New warning (FVS40) - single record TPA exceeds 1000

Variants affected: All

Description: When processing some input data sets, first noticed with FIA,
             expanded TPA values for a single tree record can be extremely
             high. This extreme TPA value can result in mathematical errors
             first found in the calulation of potential flame length in FFE
             and has been addressed. This warning has two lines so that the
             offending tree record can be identified and requires first line
             be written by errgro.f and second line written by notre.f where
             sample design expansion factor(s) are applied to inventory tree
             records. The warning message written to main output file looks
             like this:

             ********   FVS40 WARNING:  TREE RECORD REPRESENTING GREATER THAN 
             1000 TPA ENCOUNTERED. MAY CAUSE MATHEMATICAL ERRORS.

             ********   FVS40 WARNING:  TREE_ID=     5 TREE INDEX=   5 
             SPECIES= 31 DIAMETER=  0.1 TPA=13320.00

Impact on users: Users will be notified when tree records individually
                 representing greater than 1000 TPA are encountered. This will
                 be helpful if a matematical error does occur later in the
                 projection. Otherwise, the user may ignore the message but
                 should consider that 1000 trees or more behaving identially
                 in a projection is appropriate.
