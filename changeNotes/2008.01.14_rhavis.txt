Subject: Add FFE and ECON to Base and PPE,
         Cover added to AK, CA, CR, UT, WC, and PN
Name: R, Havis
Date: January 14, 2008
Variants affected: ALL

Description:

1. The FVS base model executable names have been changed by prepending the
   characters FVS to the executable name (e.g. ni.exe was changed to FVSni.exe)
   This was done because some FVS executable names were also UNIX commands
   (e.g. ls). 
   
2. The number of FVS executables available has been reduced.
   The FVS base model executables have been updated to include
   the new Economic Analysis (ECON) extension, and the Fire and Fuels Extension
   (FFE) where it is available. Separate executables will no longer be
   provided for the FFE. The ECON extension is also a part of all Parallel
   Processing Extensions (PPE), as is the FFE where it is available. 
   The ECON Users Guide will be available January 25, 2008 from the FVS Web
   site, General Technical Reports and Guides page.

3. The cover extension was added to the following variants:
   		Southeast Alaska/Coastal British Columbia (AK)
   		Inland California/Southern Cascades (CA)
   		Central Rockies (CR)
   		Pacific Northwest Coast (PN)
   		Utah (UT),
   		Westside Cascades (WC)
   The cover model is now available in all western variants.

6. A potential numerical error in the FFE model was corrected.

7. The functionality of Field 2 of the DBS STRCLASS keyword has been corrected.

Impact on users: To use the new executables, users should download a new
                 version of the Suppose software. Users should back up
                 their current executable files and and data.

Files:

delete ie, so33 / CVSHAP, CVCBMS - the coefficients are incorporated in the
                                   covr / CVSHAP, CVCBMS routines

AK, CA, CR, PN, UT and WC/makefile - added compile instructions for cover routines

./ak/obj/makefile
./base/src/revise.f
./base/src/svsnage.f - fixed a statement so that snags cannot get shorter in the SVS images
                       (this does not affect other FVS output, only the SVS images)
./bin/makefile       - modified link lists to prepend FVS to executable name and link
                       the ECON and FFE objects. Removed the ??fm.exe executables. Added ECON
                       and FFE objects to the PPE link lists, deleted EXECON and EXFIRE objects
                       except in AK and CS link lists
