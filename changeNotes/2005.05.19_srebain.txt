Description
The default surface fuel loadings for juniper, pinyon pine, and bristlecone
pine types were changed.

The new live and dead default surface fuel values for juniper in the 
BM, CA, EM, PN, and WC variants are from:

Ottmar, Roger D.; Vihnanek, Robert E.; Wright, Clinton S. 1998.  Stereo photo
series for quantifying natural fuels.  Volume I: mixed-conifer with mortality,
western juniper, sagebrush, and grassland types in the interior Pacific Northwest.
PMS 830.  Boise, ID: National Wildfire Coordinating Group, National Interagency
Fire Center.  73 p.

The default litter loadings for juniper, pinyon pine, and bristlecone pine in the 
UT and CR variants were also lowered.

The litter decay rates were also changed for some variants.  For the California
variants (WS, NC, CA, and the California portion of SO), the default litter decay
rate was reduced from 0.65 to 0.5.  

Lastly, the species-specific lbs/cuft conversion factors used in calculating biomass
from volume were corrected.

Impact on users:
There may be changes in predicted fuel loadings.  This may affect other parts of 
the model, such as the fuel model selected and the predicted fire behavior and fire effects.
