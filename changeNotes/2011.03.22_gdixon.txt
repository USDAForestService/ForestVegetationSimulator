Variants affected: 1) CA (Inland California and Southern Cascades)
                   2) BM (Blue Mountains) and CA variants
                   3) PN (Pacific Northwest) and WC (West Cascades) variants

Description: 1) The default value for live fuel loadings for shrubs in initiating stands
                has been corrected from 0.10 to 1.00 for whitebark pine, knobcone pine, 
                lodgepole pine, Coulter pine, limber pine, and other softwoods.
             
             2) The default value for live fuel loadings for herbs and shrubs in initiating stands
                has been corrected from 0.13 and 1.63, respectively, to 0.10 and 2.06,
                respectively, for western juniper. The same values for established stands have 
                been corrected from 0.04 and 0.05, respectively, to 0.14 and 0.35, respectively.
                New values are from Ottmar's photo series volume 1. 
                
             3) The default value for live fuel loadings for shrubs in established stands of
                mountain hemlock has been corrected from 0.20 to 0.10 to match those for grand fir.

Impact on users: Users not entering their own fuel loading values may notice small differences in 
                 live fuel loading estimates.
