Description:
An error was corrected in the tree record compression algorithm.

Impact on users:
This will allow simulations to run that previously bombed during compression.

Modified Files:
base/src/comprs.f - changed the after compression computation of crown ratio so that it would 
                    work properly when crown ratio was negative. (FFE and other extensions set
                    crown ratio to a negative value to stop base FVS from growing crowns for
                    a cycle in certain situations.)
