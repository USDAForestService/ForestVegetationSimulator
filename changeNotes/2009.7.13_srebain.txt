Subject: Fire and Fuels Extension Update - Southern and Central States Variants
Name:  Stephanie Rebain
Date:  07/13/2009
Variants affected: SN and CS

Description:
1)  Updates were made to the Southern Variant FFE live fuel (herb and shrub) values.
     The herb and shrub values were updated for certain ecological unit codes  based on
     values in "Southern Forestry Smoke Management Guidebook" - GTR-SE-10 (Page 118).

2)  An improvement was made to the forest typing logic used in the Southern and 
    Central States variants.  (This forest typing logic is used to select a fuel model and
    set the live fuel values.)  For mixed pine and hardwoods stands, updated logic is now used to 
    determine whether pines or hardwoods are dominant.

3) When the StandSQL keyword is echoed to the main output file, the fuel loading
    output was expanded to more decimal places. 

Impact on users:
Southern and Central States simulation runs may change.  These changes will be documented in the 
next version of the FFE addendum.

Modified Files:
fire/sn/src/fmcba.f - new logic for live fuels for certain euc codes was added
fire/sn/obj/makefile - varcom.f77 was added as a common area for fmcba.f
fire/ppe/src/fmpphv.f - fmcba is now called annually for the SN variant
fire/base/src/fmmain.f - fmcba is now called annually for the SN variant
fire/sn/src/fmsnft.f - improved the logic for pine-hardwood stands (fia forest types 401, 403-407, and 409)
fire/sn/src/fmcsft.f - improved the logic for pine-hardwood stands (fia forest types 401, 403-407, and 409)
fire/sn/src/fmburn.f - added additional call to fmcba if a fire occurs so that
                       updated herb and shrub values are reported in the SN variant
dbs/src/dbsstandin.f - echoed back the fuel loadings in the *.out file with more decimal places
