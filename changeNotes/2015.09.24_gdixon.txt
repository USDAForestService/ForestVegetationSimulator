Subject: Mortality estimates when there are no Organon "Big 6" trees in a stand

Variants affected: OC, OP

Description: When there aren't any Organon "Big 6" trees in a stand, Organon routines will not run and
             growth and mortality estimates come from FVS equations. In this case, the array holding Organon mortality   
             estimates was not being initialized properly which in turn caused errant mortality estimates. This was
             discovered while testing the stop/start feature in these two variants. The problem has now been corrected.

Impact on users: Users of these two variants should obtain a new executable. Mortality estimates are now different when there
                 are no Organon "Big 6" trees in a stand.

Files:
oc/src
  dgdriv.f  set the Organon mortality estimates to 0. when there are no Organon "Big 6" trees in the stand.

op/src
  dgdriv.f  set the Organon mortality estimates to 0. when there are no Organon "Big 6" trees in the stand.
