Climate-FVS Called from  Purpose
clauestb    gradd        Adds new trees
clgmult     dgdriv       Computes growth multiplier
clin        initre       Processed keywords
clinit      initre       Initializes variables 
clmaxden    sdical       Adjusts maximum density
clmorts     morts        Computes mortality rate

Notes:
1. gradd, initre, and sdical are base routines.
2. dgdriv and morts are variant specific; changes are done
   to each one as needed.
3. clauestb operates by adding "natural" keywords via 
   the event monitor. 
4. clgmult loads wk4 with tree-level multipliers and 
   applies them to DDS later in the routine.
   This means that code revisions occur beyond simply
   adding the call to dgdriv.
5. clmaxden modifies the density computed by sdical.
6. clmorts modifies wk2 (the FVS mortality rate), this
   is done prior to processing fixmort keywords so fixmort
   can override the climate-fvs rates.
