Subject: CCAdj Keyword
Name: M. Shettles
Date: March 30, 2017
Variants affected: All 

CCAdj Keyword Description: 

	1. Allows user to modify the overlap assumption when estimating percent canopy
	cover using different overlap corrections based upon a range of user-defined 
	classes on non-uniformity.

	2. Is able to tie-in with the ThinCC keyword to alter removal quantities 
	(e.g., basal area, TPA, volume, etc.) based upon PCC targets and 
	user-specified non-randomness

	3. Is schedulable conditionally using dynamism of FVS Event Monitor

Impact on users: users should obtain new executables if they want to use this keyword.

Files: 
__/src/grinit.f - Added GLOCCC and CCCOEF to all of the variant folders
base/src/covolp.f - Rearranged the cover equation to allow the variable
		    CCCOEF (overlap correction factor) to be represented.
base/src/cuts.f - Added conditional call to SSTAGE and logic to determine 
		  crown area removals for THINCC when used with CCADJ
base/src/evldx.f - Updated call to COVOLP to include CCCOEF
