Subject: Miscellaneous changes in the FVS-ORGANON variants
Name: Gary Dixon
Date: 09/14/2017
Variants affected: OC and OP

Description: Continued enhancement of the OC and OP variants, so they produce answers consistent with the
stand-alone ORGANON growth and yield model (also see bulletin 2017.08.03_gdixon.txt). Changes included in
this group include:

1) For volume estimation, BLM users want to use BLM equations currently available in the National Volume
   Estimator Library, rather than ORGANON BLM equations (that we don't have anyway). Changes documented
   in bulletin 2017.08.03_gdixon.txt relating to BLM volume equations have been taken out, and linkages to
   the BLM volume equations in the NVEL have been instituted.

2) The print format for the ORGINFO keyword has been revised to fit a standard printer page width.

3) Radial growth is now being sent to subroutine PREPARE instead of diameter growth to correct a problem
   with calibrating the ORGANON module.

4) A new ORGANON parameters table was developed to help the ORGANON settings to stand out from the
   FVS settings.

Impact on users: Projections will be different. Users of these two variants should obtain a new executable. 

Files:
/common/ORGANON.F77        Took out the variables BLMMIND, BLMRA, and ORGVEQ related to choosing ORGANON
                           BLM volume equations.
/base/src initre.f         Took out the call to subroutine ORGTAB. Corrected a comment statement.

/oc/src/cratet.f           Changed variable RADGRO(i) to be DG(i)/2 for the call to PREPARE. Fixed the number
                           of records with missing crown ratios being reported in the Calibration Statistics
                           Table. Changed breast high age calculation to be (total age - 6) instead of
                           (total age - 5) to match ORGANON. Inserted a call to subroutine ORGTAB after the
                           call to subroutine SDICHK. Took out the printing of new calibration values.

/oc/src/grinit.f           Removed initialization of variables BLMMIND, BLMRA, and ORGVEQ. Changed the default
                           value of variable LORGVOLS to .FALSE., directing FVS to use NVEL volume equations.

/op/src/cratet.f           Changed variable RADGRO(i) to be DG(i)/2 for the call to PREPARE. Fixed the number
                           of records with missing crown ratios being reported in the Calibration Statistics
                           Table. Changed breast high age calculation to be (total age - 6) instead of
                           (total age - 5) to match ORGANON. Inserted a call to subroutine ORGTAB after the
                           call to subroutine SDICHK. Took out the printing of new calibration values.

/op/src/grinit.f           Removed initialization of variables BLMMIND, BLMRA, and ORGVEQ. Changed the default
                           value of variable LORGVOLS to .FALSE., directing FVS to use NVEL volume equations.

/organon/src/orgtab.f      Reformatted to more closely match ORGANON.

/organon/src/orin.f        Changed the print format of the ORGINFO keyword so it doesn't exceed a standard
                           page width (132 characters). Removed the BLMVOL keyword. Removed the OSU/BLM switch
                           from the ORGVOLS keyword.
                           
/organon/src/prepare.f     Changed the initialization of the TDATAI array to integer 0's, not real 0.0's.

/organon/src/varget.f      Removed integer variables BLMRA and ORGVEQ, and the real variable BLMMIND.

/organon/src/varput.f      Removed integer variables BLMRA and ORGVEQ, and the real variable BLMMIND.
