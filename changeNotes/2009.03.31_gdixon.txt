Subject: Correction to setting of the ABIRTH array for seedlings originating via PLANT or
         NATURAL keywords.
         Correction to double incrementing of ABIRTH for quaking aspen, paper birch, and
         mountain maple.
         Change to a debug format statement to prevent field overflow when tpa values
         are 1000 or larger for a tree record.

Description: The age of seedlings originating via the PLANT or NATURAL keywords was being set
             incorrectly. This had other consequences such as the incorrect estimated seedling
             height growth for the cycle in which the trees were established if the planting 
             date was more than 5 years before the end of the cycle. These problems affected
             all species in all variants. For aspen, paper birch, and mountain maple in the IE
             variant, and aspen and paper birch in the 19 species version of EM variant, 
             this also resulted in incorrect estimated height growth estimates
             as long as the tree was considered a "small" tree for FVS modeling purposes.
             
             The seedling age for aspen, paper birch, and mountain maple in the IE
             variant, and aspen and paper birch in the 19 species version of EM variant,
             was being double incremented by the cycle length which resulted in 
             a slight underestimation of small tree height growth.
             
             One of the write statements used by model developers for debuging program code 
             was resulting in a print field overflow anytime the tpa representation for a tree
             record was 1000 or larger.
             
             These problems have been corrected.
