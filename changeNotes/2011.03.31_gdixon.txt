Description: In variants using the Weibull distribution to estimate crown ratios on trees 
             with DBH 1.0" and larger, an iterative procedure has been replaced with a
             direct computation. This makes the code more efficient.

Impact on users:  Users of the AK, BM, CA, CI, EC, EM, IE, NC, PN, SN, SO, TT, UT, WC,
                  and WS variants need to obtain a new executable. Projections may be 
                  very slightly affected by this change. In addition to being more efficient
                  the estimated crown ratio is now rounded to the nearest percent rather
                  than being truncated. This changes the crown ratio on some trees by 1%
                  either up or down.

Files:
                
xx/src          where xx = AK, AN, BM, CA, CI, EC, EM, IE, NC, PN, SN, SO, TT, UT, WC, WS
   crown.f      changed the date of revision; deleted variable KNT and IFLAG from the variable
                declarations; deleted the initialization of IFLAG and replace the iteration
                logic with a direct computation for estimating crown ratio from the Weibull
                distribution.
