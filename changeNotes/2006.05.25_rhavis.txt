Subject: R8 Merch. Height

Variants affected: CS, LS, NE, SE, SN

Description: (SE, SN) Measurements group added an algorithm, internal to their code, that
             calculates the height-to-Merch. top. This algorithm was implemented
             rather than the SVELHT routine, which was unreliable for short trees.

             (CS, LS, NE, SE, SN) The CFVOLEQU keyword can be used to define parameters
             for Cubic Foot volume calculations. A problem in this keyword was corrected.
             There was only a problem when users were specifying an equation with a
             d2h coefficient.


Impact on users: Users should obtain new executables. Volumes may be sightly affected.

Files: 
./base/src/revise.f
./ls/src/cfvol.f     - corrected a problem with usage of the d2h variable in the
                       user-specified volume equations. 
./sn/src/varvol.f    - removed call to SEVLHT routine. adapted to use Merch. height
                       calculated in the volume routines.
