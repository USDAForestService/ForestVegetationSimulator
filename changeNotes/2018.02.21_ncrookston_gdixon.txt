Variants affected: All variants

Description: Code testing revealed coding logic that could potentially produce underflow errors during execution.
             These changes guard against that happening.

Impact on users: Users should obtain a new executable at their convenience.

Files:
base/src exfire.f Initialization X6 = 0. was added in ENTRY FMSFALL to avoid an underflow error in the calling 
                  subroutine. Some cosmetic subroutine formatting was also done.

ci/src  regent.f  A CASE DEFAULT was added to all SELECT CASE statements.  

dbs/src dbscase.f The file name suffix was not being stripped correctly causing an invalid subscript.
                  Code was added to fix this error. 

ec/src  regent.f  The $ID date-of-revision line was implemented. Initialization of variables DAT45, DK, and DKK 
                  was added before the SELECT CASE statement in the diameter lookup section.  

fire/ni/src 
       fmsfall.f  The $ID date-of-revision line was implemented. A couple of comment statements were edited.
                  Initialization of variable DFALLN to 0. was added at the beginning of the subroutine.

ls/src  sitset.f  The variable ISISP was being used as an array subscript, and it potentially could be zero.
                  The code was revised so ISISP gets assigned the default value if it is zero, before it gets
                  used as a subscript.

ne/src  regent.f  The $ID date-of-revision line was implemented. The variable D in the second call to subroutine 
                  BALMOD was undefined, and replaced with DBH(I).

oc/src  cratet.f  Code was inserted to avoid using variable IPTR as an array subscript when it is zero in the
                  crown ratio dubbing section.

op/src  cratet.f  Code was inserted to avoid using variable IPTR as an array subscript when it is zero in the
                  crown ratio dubbing section.

         morts.f  A bound on variable CRADJ was inserted to avoid an underflow error as CR increases.

organon/src 
        diagro.f  A bound on variable CRADJ was inserted to avoid an underflow error as CR increases in
                  subroutines DG_SWO, DG_NWO_RUN, DG_SMC, and DG_RAP.

      htgrowth.f  Bounds on variables FCR and CRADJ were inserted to avoid underflow errors in
                  subroutines HG_SWO, HG_NWO, HG_SMC, and HG_RAP.
          
     mortality.f  A bound on variable CRADJ was inserted to avoid an underflow error as CR increases in
                  subroutine MORTAL_RUN (5 places).

volume/src 
       f_other.f  A lower bound on variable DR was inserted to avoid an underflow error for small values
                  in subroutine BRK_OT.
       
        r8vol2.f  Initialization of variables BTR and DBTBH to 0. was added in subroutine R8CLARK.

wc/src   morts.f  The C $ID date of change line was implemented. A bound on variable CRADJ was inserted
                  to avoid an underflow error as CR increases.
