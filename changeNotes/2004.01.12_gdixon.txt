Description: Historically, we used FIA codes 001 for other softwoods, and 004 for other hardwoods.
This followed some reporting standards established by the FS years ago. About a year, or so, ago
Don Vandendriesche asked Bob Havis to change the 001 to 290 and 004 to 990 so his FVSSTAND program 
would sort the other softwoods to the bottom of all softwoods, and other hardwoods to the bottom
of all hardwoods. The change was made to most variants but not all, and without consulting the 
latest FIA code list, and without first checking to see if the 001 and 004 were standard codes for
these categories or not. FIA now says these codes were for reporting convience and are no longer
used. However 990 is the code for Arizona-ironwood. To accomodate both current FIA coding and to
accomodate FVSSTAND, I have made the following changes.
1. Changed FIA code 990 to 998 for "other live hardwood". Code 998 is not currently used by FIA
and code 999 is used for their "unknown dead hardwood" category. In FVS we currently use 999 for 
"Other (OT)" which is still a conflict, but I didn't change this as yet. The best solution to this
would be to make sure each variant had an other softwood and other hardwood category rather than 
just an "other" category.
2. Changed FIA code 290 to 298 for "other live softwood". Code 298 is not currently used by FIA
and code 299 is used for their "unknown dead softwood" category.

While examining current FIA codes and alpha codes, I also corrected some inconsistencies:
3. In the CA variant, I changed FIA code 330 to 333 for California buckeye
4. In the IE variant, I changed FIA code 106 to 133 for single-leaf pinyon
5. In the PN and WC variants, I changed FIA code 376 to 375 for paper birch, and 060 to 064 
   for western juniper.
6. In the CS variant, I changed the alpha code CW to EC for eastern cottonwood; the FIA code 410
   to -13 (the negative Dennis Donnelly established to signify this species category is not a
   recognized FIA species category); the alpha code HB to HK for hackberry.
7. In the LS variant, I changed the alpha code CW to EC for eastern cottonwood; the alpha code HB
   to HK for hackberry; the FIA code 766 to 760 for plum; the FIA code 993 to -14 for Other
   Commercial Hardwoods.
8. In the NE variant, I changed the alpha code HB to HK for hackberry; the FIA code 830 to 809 for
   Northern Pin Oak.
9. In the SE variant, I changed the alpha code MP to MA for American Mtn Ash; the FIA code 490 to
   491 for dogwood; the FIA code 462 to 460 for hackberry; the FIA code 652 to 650 for magnolia;
   the FIA code 310 to 935 for American Mtn Ash.
   
10. I changed /ls/src/spctrn.f to accomodate the above changes. However, this routine needs to be 
    totally rewritten to be in sync with the current FIA code list. This is underway, and the existing
    routine will suffice until that work is done. 
11. I changed /ni/src/spctrn.f to be the basis for an all-western variant species translation routine.
    Thus eliminating /ie/src/spctrn.f. This routine will now provide the basis for better translation
    of FIA codes to an appropriate category for each variant. This part of the work has not been done
    as yet, but will be done in the future. However, as a result of these changes, the variants will 
    now recognize the one- and two-character alpha designations for the same species where those still
    exist (L and WL for western larch, S and ES for Engelmann spruce; C and RC for cedar, J and JU for 
    juniper, OS and OC for other conifer (WS variant). 
    
    Accordingly, I changed the IE compile macro to now use ni/src/spctrn.f and changed the link macros
    so the routine order is consistent with coding standards.
12. I changed the /base/src/stkval.f routine to recognize 298 instead of 290 and 998 instead of 990.
13. I changed the /base/src/revise.f routine to update the date on affected variants.
