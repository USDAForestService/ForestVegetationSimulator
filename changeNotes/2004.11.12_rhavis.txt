Description: The conditional statement that branched around tree record creation
             for stump sprouts, when there were insignificant numbers (PREM) of
             sprouts, was modified to consider the value of the user input
             number of sprouts (SPRMLT).  This corrects a potential error 
             that occured in the IEX executable in the tree list compression
             code, when a 0 is used in Field 2 (multiplier on number of
             stump spouts) 

Impact on users: Users with 0 in Field 2 of the SPROUT keyword should obtain a
                 new executable.
