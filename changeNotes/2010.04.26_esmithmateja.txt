Subject: Updated Oregon White Oak growth Equations - WC and PN variants
Name:  E. Smith-Mateja
Date:  4/26/2010
Variants affected: West Cascades and Pacific Northwest Coast 

Description:
This is an update to replace the Oregon white oak (WO) growth equations
based on Gould and Harrington's research

Impact on users: Users of the WC and PN variant growing Oregon white oak 
should obtain new executables.

Modified Files:
./pn/src/blkdat.f      - for WO, sigmar values were updated based on the new
                         ln(dds) equation and coefficients for the HTCALC equation
                         were changed.
./pn/src/bratio.f      - the bark ratio equation for WO was repaced with the 
                         bark ratio equation used to fit the ln(dds) model.
./pn/src/dgf.f         - The ln(dds) for WO was replaced.
./pn/src/htcalc.f      - the height calc routines for WO is now in HTGF and not
                         a site index based equation
./pn/src/sichg.f       - the site index equation used for WO was changed from 
                         Curtis (DF) to King (DF), because WO is more likely to 
                         be found in the region coverd by the King's SI.
./pn/src/sitset.f      - a modifier based on Gould's Maximum height equation is
                         used to reduce the site index of WO to be more realistic.
./pn/src/smhtgf.f      - A new equation was added for WO small tree growth.
./wc/src/blkdat.f      - For WO, sigmar values were updated based on the new
                         ln(dds) equation and coefficients for the HTCALC equation
                         were changed.
./wc/src/bratio.f      -  the bark ratio equation for WO was repaced with the 
                         bark ratio equation used to fit the ln(dds) model.
./wc/src/dgf.f         - The ln(dds) for WO was replaced.
./wc/src/htcalc.f      - the height calc routines for WO is now in HTGF and not
                         a site index based equation
./wc/src/htgf.f        - The height growth estimate for OWO is now calculated in HTGF
                         rather than HTCALC because it is not a SI based growth equation.
./wc/src/morts.f       - The WO mortality equation was replaced.
./wc/src/sichg.f       - the site index equation used for WO was changed from 
                         Curtis (DF) to King (DF), because WO is more likely to 
                         be found in the region coverd by the King's SI.
./wc/src/sitset.f      - a modifier based on Gould's Maximum height equation is
                         used to reduce the site index of WO to be more realistic.
./wc/src/smhtgf.f      - a new equation was added for WO small tree growth.
