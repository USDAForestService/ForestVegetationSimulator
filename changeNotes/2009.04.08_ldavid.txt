Description:
Completed Climate Extension link instructions in the bin/makefile and 
added variant folders to the clim folder of the FVS source code file 
structure as necessary. 

1) Folder "clim" with subfolders added to the first level of the FVS source
   code file structure.

2) Compile makefiles added to new variant "obj" folders in clim folder.

4) fvs\bin\makefile edited for Climate Extension linkage with variants that
   were not addressed in the 03/24/09 edit. Make target "allclimate" will
