Subject: FFE Carbon Reporting Update
Name: R. Havis, D. Robinson (ESSA)
Date: August 21, 2006
Variants affected: FFE Extension only

Description:

Impact on users: None - This code is not currently availsble for users.

Files:
This package provides updates to the C reporting module currently
under development. It should not have any effect upon current 
FVS or FFE output outside the C reporting system.  After applying
these changes, a recompile of the variants will create the
preliminary release of the C accounting part of the FFE.
