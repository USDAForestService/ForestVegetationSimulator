Subject: Initialization of stagnation variables

Name: Gary Dixon
Date: 01/28/11

Variants affected: TT and UT

Description: When additional species were added to these variants, equations for
             some species came from the Central Rockies variant. One variable
             controlling the effect of stagnation on diameter and height growth
             was not being initialized properly. This has been corrected. This
             potentially would affect narrowleaf cottonwood and the other hardwoods
             grouping in the Tetons variant, and Great Basin bristlecone pine, 
             narrowleaf cottonwood, Fremont cottonwood, and boxelder in the Utah
             variant.

Impact on users: Those who use the TT or UT variants should obtain a new executable.

Files:

tt/src    grinit.f  changed the date of revision; added the GGCOM common block; added
ut src              the initialization of variables DSTAG and BAINIT, and array ISTAGF.

tt/obj    makefile  added GGCOM to the dependency list for GRINIT
