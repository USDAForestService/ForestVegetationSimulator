         species codes changed to match base FVS.

Description: The relocation of logical unit number variables to common area used to write
             the Dwarf Mistletoe Model output summaries resolves errors associated with
             executables generated outside of FMSC.
             Species code changes were a maintenance issue and brought codes used in the
             mistletoe model up to date with species code changes that have been made in
             FVS. Changes primarily involved cedar, cottonwood, larch and juniper species. 

Impact on users: Species code labels used in Dwarf Mistletoe summary tables for affected
                 species have changed.
