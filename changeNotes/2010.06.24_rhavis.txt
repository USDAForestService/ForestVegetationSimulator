Subject: Code Maintenance - IMPLICIT NONE Statement in metric code
Name: R. Havis
Date: June 24, 2010
Variants affected: ALL

Description:
The IMPLICIT NONE statement was added to routines in the metric directory where needed. Added Dunning code
write message to database stand reader, and other minor code maintenance as described below.

Impact on users: A statement in the database section of the main output file will be written when
                 dunning codes are used in CS, NC, SO and WS variants, and read from a database.
