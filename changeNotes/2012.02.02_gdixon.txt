Variants affected: All variants except KT, and NI

Description: (1) Stump sprouting for quaking aspen was not being handled consistently
             across all variants. The FMSC has updated equations predicting the 
number of aspen sprouts when aspen get cut. These equations were not being used
in the BM, CS, LS, NE, SO, or WS variants. Equations predicting the number of aspen
sprouts has now been updated in these five variants.

(2) The CI variant has the updated aspen sprouting equations but two of the variables
used in these equations were not being computed correctly. This has been corrected.

(3) The equation predicting sprout height has now been updated for all sprouting 
species in all variants. The equation is now a function of both sprout age and
species site index; the previous equation was only a function of sprout age in most
cases. Updated species are:

(4) Updated logic for handling stump sprouts when the stump list was full has been
added to the following variants: CA, CR, TT, UT, PN, and WC

(5) The number of sprout records for Pacific yew was changed from 2 to 1 in the BM, 
CA, CI, and IE variants (bulletin 2010.04.20_rhavis.txt). It was not changed in the
PN, SO, or WC variants. It has now been changed from 2 to 1 in these three variants.

(6) In making these changes, sprouting logic code was reorganized and consolidated
to make future changes and maintenance easier.

(7) In the BM variant, during site index dubbing, quaking aspen site index should 
have been to a base age 80, breast height age basis. It was being set to a base age
100, total age basis. This has been corrected.

Impact on users: There will be differences in the number of aspen sprouts, when aspen
is cut, in the BM, CI, CS, LS, NE, SO, and WS variants. There will be differences in
sprout heights for the hardwood species and variants listed in description (3) above.
There will be differences in number of sprout records in runs where Pacific yew is
cut in the PN, SO, and WC variants.

Users of all variants, except KT and NI, should obtain a new executable.

bm/src
  sichg.f    changed the date of revision; corrected aspen to a breast height age,
             80 year basis.

ci/src
 esinit.f    changed the date of revision; changed LSPRUT to .TRUE.
            
strp/src
  esuckr.f   changed the date of revision; updated and inserted extra comment statements;
             extensively revised the logic to make use of the new ESSPRT subroutine with
             it's entry points to handle variant and species specific coding, thus eliminating
             the need for variant specific versions of this routine.
  estump.f   changed the date of revision; updated and inserted extra comment statements; added
             a call to entry ESASID in subroutine ESSPRT to return the FVS index number of
             quaking aspen if quaking aspen is included in the variant. If quaking aspen is
             included then the trees-per-acre and basal area of aspen that were cut is accumulated
             for use in subroutine ESUCKR. This eliminates the need for variant specific
             version of this routine.
  essprt.f   new routine containing entry points to handle sprout computations that are variant
             and species dependent. Added to version control and compile/link instructions.
