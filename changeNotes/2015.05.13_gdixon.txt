Subject: Revamping the two FVS-Organon variants for production use
Name: Gary Dixon
Date: 05/13/15
Variants affected: OC and OP

Description: The OC and OP are variants incorporate the ORGANON growth model into FVS using the CA and PN
variants, respectively, as the starting points. The OC variant incorporates the ORGANON Southwest Oregon model type;
the OP variant the ORGANON Northwest Oregon and Stand Management Co-op model types. The resulting code is now being 
revamped to eliminate errors, make available the full array of FVS keyword options, and revamp the code conform to 
established code standards for ease of maintainence and updating.
