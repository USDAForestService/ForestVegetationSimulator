Variants affected: all

Description:

1) CS, LS,and NE variants: Board foot volumes were not correct when the
   volume equation number was different than the cubic foot volume
   equation number, using the National Volume Estimator Library
   (Method 6). This has been corrected

2) All variants: The limit on the number of fields that may be written
   to a Table of Compute Variables was increased by 33 percent.

3) All variants: FVS adds records to the tree list when there are too
                 few tree records for a good statistical representation 
                 of the stand. A problem in the tripling of diameter estimates
                was corrected.

The calculation of The upper and lower triples were being updated with error
terms from the parent tree, not error the term from the
previous cycle, and the middle term was being updated with
the error term from the previous cycle. This was corrected
so that the same error term is applied to all 3 of the triples.

4) IE and NO variants: An error in the calculation of bark ratio
                       in the mortality algorithm was corrected.
