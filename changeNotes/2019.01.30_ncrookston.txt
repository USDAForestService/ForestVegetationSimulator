Subject: New FVS_Summary2 database output. 
Name: Nick Crookston
Date: January 30, 2019
Variants affected: All

Description: Added code that builds FVS_Summary2 and FVS_Summary2_East output
 data tables that are built in place of the originals. The new tables have
 two lines of output for cycles with removals, one line for before and another
 for after. When there are no removals, there is just one line. There is a 
 column that indicates if there is or is not a removal and if the line contains
 the before or after removal data. 
 
 This code is completely upward compatable with the original. 
 
 These tables has only been programmed in the dbsqlite version, not the ODBC
 based database extension. 

Impact on users: NONE unless the number 2 is added to the Data Base Extension
"Summary" keyword in field 1. Then, the FVS_Summary2 tables are built in place
of their counterparts.

changeNotes/2019.01.30_ncrookston.txt these notes.

common/OUTCOM.F77 -- added 3 variables: TRTCUFT, TRMCUFT, and TRBDFT which
 hold cummulative removals in the respective units.
 
pg/putstd.f and pg/getstd.f -- save and restored TRTCUFT, TRMCUFT, and TRBDFT

dbsqlite/dbsin.f -- Added an option to the database "SUMMARY" keyword that
 switches on the FVS_Summary2 output table format. A value of 2 field 1 turns on
 the new versions of the tables. Only one version is produced in a given case 
 (that is, you can create Summery in one stand and Summary2 in another).
 
vbase/disply.f -- Keeps TRTPA, TRTCUFT, TRMCUFT, and TRBDFT updated as needed and 
  calls DBSSUMRY2 to write FVS_Summary2 output

vdbs/dbssumry.f -- added a do-nothing subroutine to resolve the reference to
  subroutine DBSSUMRY2 in the ODBC-based database extension
vdbsqlite/dbssumry.f -- added DBSSUMRY2 to produce the FVS_SUmmary2 output in
  the SQLite-linked version. 
                                                                      
tests/qFVSie/ie.key -- added commands to write FVS_Summary and FVS_Summary2 
  database tables
tests/qFVSie/ie.db_dump.txt.save -- updated output.

tests/qFVSsn/sn.key -- added commands to write FVS_Summary_East and 
  FVS_Summary2_East database tables.   
tests/qFVSsn/snout.txt.save -- updated output.
