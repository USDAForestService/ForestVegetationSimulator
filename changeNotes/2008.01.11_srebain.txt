Subject: Fire and Fuels Extension - Central States Variant
Name:  Stephanie Rebain
Date:  01/11/2008
Variants affected: Central States (CS)

Description:
The Fire and Fuels Extension was calibrated for the Central States variant of FVS.
Model relationships were based on those used in the Southern FFE model
or other eastern variants.

Impact on users:
This is a new feature for CS FVS users.
FFE will be available for selection with the CS variant in the next version
of Suppose.
These changes are documented in the FFE addendum document.

Modified Files:
dbs/src/dbsfmpf.f - made adjustments for the exporting of the CS potential
                    fire report to match the format of the SN variant
fire/base/src/fmburn.f - made some adjustments for CS-FFE
fire/base/src/fmpofl.f - made some adjustments for CS-FFE      
fire/base/src/fmcrowls.f - added some comments       
fire/base/src/fmeff.f - added some specific mortality adjustments for CS-FFE
bin/makefile - changes made to compile CS-FFE (added ffe to FVScs and FVScs_new; 
               deleted exfire in CS_Link, added fire_cs_compile and FIRE_CS_OBJ)
ec/src/forkod.f - corrected the spelling of "Pinchot"
cs_new/obj/makefile - deleted exfire
bin/FCWindows_NT.make - added dbsfmcrpt.obj and dbsfmhrpt.obj to the CS link
                        list

New Files:
fire/cs/src/fmsnag.f - has the CS-FFE snag relationships
fire/cs/src/fmvinit.f - initializes many variables within CS-FFE
fire/cs/src/fmcfmd.f - the CS-FFE fuel model selection logic
fire/cs/src/fmcsft.f - calculates a forest type, used in fmcba and fmcfmd
fire/cs/src/fmcba.f - estimates initial dead fuel loadings and herb and shrub
                       loadings
fire/cs/src/fmcrow.f - calculates the crown biomass for individual trees
fire/cs/src/fmbrkt.f - has the bark thickness values for CS-FFE
fire/cs/src/fmcblk.f - has the variant-specific carbon parameters
fire/cs/obj/makefile - changes made to compile CS-FFE
