Variants affected: All variants

Description: A new event monitor function, HERBSHRB(i), was added. When the FFE
             extension is active, HERBSHRB(1) returns the total herbs in tons/acre;
             HERBSHRB(2) returns the total shrubs in tons/acre; and HERBSHRB(3)
             returns the total herbs and shrubs in tons/acre, at the cycle boundaries.
             These values are from the FFE Fuels Output Report.

Impact on users: None, however users wanting to use this new function should obtain
                 a new variant executable.
