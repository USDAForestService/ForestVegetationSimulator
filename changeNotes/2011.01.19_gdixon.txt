Subject: (1) Revision of FINDAG logic
         (2) Addition of READCORH logic to AK, BM, CA, EC, NC,and WC variants
         (3) Correction to logic determining whether a stand is even-aged or uneven-aged
             in the TT and UT variants

Variants affected: All variants

Description: (1) Expansion of the WS variant from 11 to 43 species requires a revision
                 of the FINDAG calling logic. The code, while working correctly, was calling 
FINDAG for every tree record several times each projection cycle whether FINDAG needed to be 
called or not. Since one of the routines calling FINDAG is base/src/comcup.f, changes needed 
to be made throughout all variants. The FINDAG logic was rewritten and standardized across all 
variants.

(2) Large tree height growth multipliers entered using the READCORH keyword were
not being used in the AK, BM, CA, EC, NC, or WC variants. This has been corrected.

(3) The determination of whether a stand was even-aged or uneven-aged was not including 
trees of all species in the TT and UT variants. This has been corrected.

Impact on users: (1) None. These changes do not affect projection results.
                 (2) Affects the AK, BM, CA, EC, NC, and WC variants if the READCORH 
                     keyword if being used.
                 (3) May be some growth impacts on the species using surrogate equations from
                     the Central Rockies variant, depending on the even-aged or uneven-aged
                     stand determination.
