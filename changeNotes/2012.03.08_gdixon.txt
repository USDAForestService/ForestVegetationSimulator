Variants affected: EC (East Cascades)

Description: 1) At the request of R6 this variant has been expanded from 
                10 individual species and 1 "other" species group for all 
additional species, to 30 individual species and 2 species groups including 
other softwoods and other hardwoods. Species now contained in this variant are:

 *Apparently, in the inventory data the FIA code for Rocky Mountain maple (321) 
 was used for vine maple. In the expanded EC variant, FIA code 321 is mapped to
 vine maple by the species translator.
 

New species are modeled using existing growth equations from species in the
EC and WC variants.

2) For R6 forests, some species use surrogate Crookston equations to calculate crown width. The
   BF adjustment for these species was not being correctly mapped in all cases. This has been
   corrected. Affected species are: 
   BM variant: other softwoods (OS) on the Umatilla NF
   CA variant: Coulter pine (CP) on the Siskiyou NF
   EC variant: other softwoods (OS) on the Mount Baker - Snoqualmie, Okanogan (Tonasket RD), and
               Wenatchee NF's
   IE variant: other softwoods (OS) on the Colville NF
   NC variant: other conifers (OC) on the Siskiyou NF
   SO variant: other softwoods (OS) on the Deschutes, Fremont, and Winema NF's
   
   
Impact on users: 1)Users of the EC variant should obtain a new executable. Projections for the
   original individual EC species (WP, WL, DF, SF, RC, GF, LP, ES, AF, and PP)
   will be different, for most forests, due to changes in small tree height growth. 
   Projections for the Other (OT) species grouping will be different due to 
   this grouping now being split into other softwoods (OS) and other hardwoods (OH). 
   The OS grouping uses the original OT grouping equations for
   tree growth but different Curtis-Arney ht-dbh functions used in dubbing heights missing in
   the input data and in small tree height growth. The OH grouping uses quaking aspen
   equations from the WC variant for tree growth and other hardwoods Curtis-Arney ht-dbh
   functions. 
   
   2)Users of the BM, CA, EC(11 species version), IE, NC, and SO variants should obtain a new 
   executable. Growth projections will remain unchanged, but crown width estimates will be 
   different for the species and forests shown above.
