Subject: PARMS functionality

Description:

1) A change was made so that if a keyword used PARMS() and an uppercase "P" was read prior
   to the PARMS() statement in columns 11-80, it will now read the PARMS statement after the "P".
 
Impact on users:
Users should obtain new executables. 

Modified Files:

./base/src/keyrdr.f  - after it encounters a "P" or "p" it has to search for the whole word "PARMS".
