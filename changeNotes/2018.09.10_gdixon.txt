Subject: General code cleanup

Name: Gary Dixon

Date: 09/10/2018

Variants affected: All

Description: These changes are part of a general FVS code cleanup. Common arrays have been edited so the format
             is consistent and variables appear in alphabetical order. Subroutines for which there was a /base
             version used in western variants and sometimes the SN variant, and a /ls version used in the CS, LS,
             NE, and sometimes SN variants, were combined into a single version and stored in /vbase. The /base
             and /ls versions were deleted, and the source list files were updated accordingly.

Impact on users: Users should not be impacted by these changes.

/vbase    gheads.f Added the PRGPRM.F77 and CONTRL.F77 labelled common blocks. Formatted the variable declaration
                   section. Combined the /base and /ls versions using a SELECT CASE structure based on the variant
                   alpha code. Modified the TWIGS-based section to use a MAX function when printing the title for
                   the stand composition table. Changed a T35 to a T34 in the 10 FORMAT statement so it is
                   consistent with the 20 FORMAT statement. Stored the resulting combined version in /vbase. 
                   Modified all the source list files to use the /vbase version. Deleted the /base and /ls versions.

          prtexm.f Added the PRGPRM.F77 and CONTRL.F77 labelled common blocks. Formatted the variable declaration
                   section. Combined the /base and /ls versions using a SELECT CASE structure based on the variant
                   alpha code. Corrected a spelling error in a comment statement. Reordered the statement labels
                   in ascending order. Note: the combined version contains the return code testing that the
                   /ls version did not. This is good. Stored the resulting combined version in /vbase. 
                   Modified all the source list files to use the /vbase version. Deleted the /base and /ls versions.

          prtrls.f Formatted the variable declaration, deleted variables RTR1 and RTR2 from the /ls version.
                   Combined the /base and /ls versions using a SELECT CASE structure based on the variant
                   alpha code. Stored the resulting combined version in /vbase. Modified all the source list files
                   to use the /vbase version. Deleted the /base and /ls versions.

           ptbal.f Formatted the labelled COMMON and variable declaration sections. 
                   Combined the /base and /ls versions using a SELECT CASE structure based on the variant
                   alpha code. Added setting the point basal area arrays to 0.0 for eastern variants. Corrected
                   mixed mode settings. Formatted the comment statements. Ordered the statment labels. Added 
                   some debug write statments. Stored the resulting combined version in /vbase. Modified all 
                   the source list files to use the /vbase version. Deleted the /base and /ls versions.

          sumhed.f Formatted the variable declaration section. Combined the /vbase and /ls versions using a 
                   SELECT CASE structure based on the variant alpha code, using the vbase tab settings in the
                   format statements. Stored the resulting combined version in /vbase. Modified all the 
                   source list files to use the /vbase version. Deleted the /ls version.

          sumout.f Formatted the variable declaration section. 

/ls       gheads.f Deleted. Combined with the /base version and stored in /vbase (see /vbase description).

          prtexm.f Deleted. Combined with the /base version and stored in /vbase (see /vbase description).

          prtrls.f Deleted. Combined with the /base version and stored in /vbase (see /vbase description).

           ptbal.f Deleted. Combined with the /base version and stored in /vbase (see /vbase description).

          sumhed.f Deleted. Combined with the /vbase version and stored in /vbase (see /vbase description).

          sumout.f Deleted. It was no longer used. Eastern variants were previously integrated into the
                   /vbase version.
