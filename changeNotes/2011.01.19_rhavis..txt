Subject: Numerical Error Caused by Negative CRs
Name: R. Havis

Description: When the FFE changes the crown ratio (CR) of of a tree, it
             sets the crown ratio carried in the base model to a negative value.
             When all trees in a stand were killed in a simulated fire (so total
             probability in the treelist equals zero) the crown routines did not
             set the crown ratios back to positive values. This caused a numerical error.
             It has been corrected.

Impact on users: When all trees in a stand are killed by fire, FVS will process the stand
                 through until the end of the simulation rather than potentially failing
                 with a numerical error.

Files:

CROWN - added logic to set CR to absolute value of CR when branching out of routine
        with trees in tree list but total probability = 0.
