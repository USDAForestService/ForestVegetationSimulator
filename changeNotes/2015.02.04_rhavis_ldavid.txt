Variants affected: ALL

Description:

1) All variants: Variables calculated with the Event Monitor may be written
                 to database tables and Excel spreadsheets as well as
                 to text files. There was a problem writing compute variables
                 to the FVS_Compute table in Excel, only the variable values
                 from the first stand in a serial run were written, values
                 from subsequent stands were absent. The problem was introduced
                 in version 1398 of FVS, January 6, 2015. This has been corrected.

Impact on users: Event monitor users should obtain new executables.
