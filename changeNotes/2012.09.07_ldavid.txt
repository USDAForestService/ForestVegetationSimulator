Variants affected: All

Description: Columns were added to the FFE Snag Summary Report for total values
             (TPA) of hard snags, soft snags and grand total of hard and soft
             snags. These total columns are not affected by the diameter size
             class designations and always include snags of all sizes. New
             column names added the the database Snag Summary table are:
             Hard_snags_total, Soft_snags_total, Hard_soft_snags_total.


Impact on users: Users should obtain new executables. And do note that the new
                 executable will not add cases to existing output database Snag
                 Summary tables that were created with previous FVS versions due
                 to the new columns that have been added to this table.

Files:

./dbs/src/dbsfmssnag.f   - added three "total" columns to Snag Summary table which
                           also required additions to the subroutine parameters.
./fire/base/src/fmssum.f - added summation of total hard and soft by expanding
                           THD and TSF arrays to 7 and using element 7 for total.
                           Variable THDSF was added for total hard and soft value.
                           Three columns added to the SNAG SUMMARY REPORT.
                           Parameters on call to DBSFMSSNAG modified to include
                           new columns written to database.
