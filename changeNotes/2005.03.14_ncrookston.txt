Description:
Very large PPE runs, with many reports are taking too long to process. In
addition some other changes were made while addressing some failed PPE
runs.

Impact on users:
In PPE runs where there are over 2000 reports is to write the scratch file,
the program creates a permanent file named "<keywordFileName>_genrpt.txt".
The "user" can post process this report with a post processor that is yet
to be produced.

Files:
base/src/genrpt.f -- modified so that large "general report" scratch files are
                     are turned into perminate files for post processing. Also changed the
                     general report file number from 99 to 93 to avoid a file number conflict
                     when more than one diract access file is used.
ppbase/src/ppmain.f -- modified for the genrpt change plus inhanced debug output
base/src/main.f -- modified for genrpt change


base/src/oprdat.f -- changed the way stand ids are compared to those in input activity files
base/src/sstage.f -- removed the equivalence statement
base/src/update.f -- trap killing over 100% of the trees per acre

ppbase/src/grcend.f -- removed extra call to cwidth and added call to natcrz
ppbase/src/hvsel.f  -- added some debug output
ppbase/src/sparls.f -- modified debug output
