Subject: Fire and Fuels Extension Update
Name:  Stephanie Rebain
Date:  09/12/2005
Variants affected: ALL FFE variants

Description:
The canopy bulk density values in all FFE variants were capped at 0.35 kg/m3.
The LS-FFE fuel model logic was updated to account for potential numerical errors.
The LS-FFE crown biomass equations were improved.

Impact on users:
There should be small changes in LS-FFE output.  Output from other FFE variants
may be different in cases where unreasonably high canopy bulk density values were being
reported.

Files:
fire/base/src/fmpocr.f - canopy bulk density values capped at 0.35.
fire/base/src/fmcrowls.f - Different crown biomass equations are used for submerch and 
                           merchantable trees.  A weighted average of these equations 
                           is now used when near the dbh breakpoint.
fire/ls/src/fmcfmd.f - changed fuel model logic to correct potential numerical errors.
