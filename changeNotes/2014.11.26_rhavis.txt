Description: Defines a group of points that can be referenced by a single name
             or group number, and will be treated as a group in management actions
             or event monitor functions. Users may define up to 30 point groups
             with each group containing up to 50 points. If the group name is
             entered in the point field of a keyword, the keyword action will
             apply to all points in the group. One or more supplemental records
             are required that contain the FVS input point numbers.                                                                                                           
             When using the SETPTHIN keyword or the SPMCDBH event monitor function,
             a point can be referenced by point number identified in the input
             data or the FVS point sequence number (see the POINTREF keyword).
             Similarly, point groups can be referenced by their group name defined
             in field 1, or by their FVS point group sequence number. FVS sequence
             numbers for poin6t groups are assigned by FVS and are contained in the
             range (-1 to -30). When referencing point groups on keywords, users are
             encouraged to use the group name instead of the FVS group sequence number.

Impact on users: DOwnload a new executable to use the point group keyword
