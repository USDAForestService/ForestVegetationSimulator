Subject: ODBC Upgrade, Misc. Bug Fixes and Code Maintenance
Name: R. Havis
Date: October 17, 2011
Variants affected: ALL

Description:

1) Nick updated the FVS ODBC connection so that FVS can read/write to
   Office 2007 files (i.e. accdb, and .xlsx files). Work is underway
   to connect the Suppose interface to Office 2007 files.

2) When using FSveg data, the PV Code / PV Reference Code sets are used to 
   assign a stand habitat type that FVS recognizes. There was a problem if
   a user reassigned the stand habitat type to an FVS habitat type code
   with a StdInfo keyword after a PV Code / PV Reference Code set had
   been processed. This has been corrected.

3) The default sawtimiber Merch. Specs. for eastern redcedar in the Central
   States variant were incorrect. They were changed so the sawtimber minimum
   DBH is 6.0 inches, and the sawtimber minimum top diameter is 5.0 inches.
   
4) The estimated height was not being populated in the database cutlist table.
   This has been corrected.

Impact on users: All users should obtain new executables.

Files:

GROHED (all variants) - The SVN variable is assigned using a data statement
                        in the includeSVN.f include file. The include statement
                        occurred before the declaration of the SVN variable. This
                        has been corrected in all GROHED files.
