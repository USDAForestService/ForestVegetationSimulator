Subject: Crown Ratio Change Update
Name: Robert Havis
Date: September 22, 2005
Variants affected: ALL

Description:
By default, FVS automatically applies limits on the internally
calculated rate of increase and rate of decrease in crown ratio
each cycle. These limits are applied before the optional user
adjustments to the crown ratio change that can be specified
using the CRNMULT keyword.
 
1) By default, FVS automatically applies limits on the internally
calculated rate of increase and rate of decrease in crown ratio
each cycle. These limits are applied before the optional user
adjustments to crown ratio change that can be specified
using the CRNMULT keyword.

2) There was no limit on the increase in crown ratio in the
AK variant. This has been changed to a 3% limit in the change
in crown ratio per year.

3) The CRNMULT keyword and the crown ratio change limits were not
a part of the KT and NI variants, and were not applied to species 
sequence numbers 1-11 in the IE variant. This has been
changed so the CRNMULT keyword and crown ratio change limits are
applied in all these cases.

Impact on users: Crown ratio change limits will be adjusted based on
the number of years in each cycle in all variants. If using a
default variant cycle length, this update will affect the
AK, KT, IE, NI, variants for the reasons described above. 
In teh NC and SN vraiants the crown ratio change limits will be 5%
per standard 5 year cycle rather than 10% per cycle before the change.
If using a non-default cycle length, the output results in all
variants may be affected by these changes.
