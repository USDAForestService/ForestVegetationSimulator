Subject: TREESZCP implementation for large tree diameter growth
Name: Gary Dixon
Date: 03/24/05
Variants affected: All variants

Description: The TREESZCP keyword was implemented about 3/4/05 but not  
announced to the public because it wasn't fully functional. To date it
only affected mortality. These changes make it also affect large tree
diameter growth.

Impact on users: None at this point.
