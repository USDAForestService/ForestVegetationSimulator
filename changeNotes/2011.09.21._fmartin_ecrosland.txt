Subject: ECON Extension Updates
Name: F. Martin, E. Crosland
Date: September 21, 2011
Variants affected: ALL

Description: Two new Event Monitor variables have been added to the Economic
             Extension (ECON). These variables represent the cubic foot and
             board foot harvest volumes that ECON valued. Depending on ECON keywords,
             these variable values may be substantially different from the harvest
             amounts listed elsewhere by FVS, e.g., some harvest volume may have
             no economic value because log sizes or species were not saleable. 
             
             ECCUFT    cubic feet valued by ECON
             ECBDFT    board feet valued by ECON


Impact on users: Uses of the ECON extension should obtain a new executable.
