Description: Small tree height increment for aspen and paper birch utilized
             incorrect equations on tree records that where generated as a 
             result of the tripling process. The tripled records were receiving
             exagerated height growth values.
             

Impact on users: Small tree growth results for aspen and paper birch will
                 reflect common behavior for both original and tripled tree
                 records. Simulations with small aspen and paper birch that
                 did not invoke the tripling process on tree records of
                 these two species will be unchanged.                 

Files:
cr\src\regent.f - The location in which to begin the processing of a tripled
                  record was moved from line 300 to 265 so that it precedes
                  special processing for aspen and paper birch.
