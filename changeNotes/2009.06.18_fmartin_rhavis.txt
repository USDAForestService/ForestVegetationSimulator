Subject: ECON extension enhancements
Name: R. Havis, coded by Fred Martin, Washington DNR
Date: June 18, 2008
Variants affected: ALL

Description

1) Added four columns to the ECON summary text report and the Econ
   Summary database table; harvested total merch cubic volume
   (saw log merch cubic for the east), harvested board foot volume,
   discount rate, and user-input (known) SEV.

2. Eliminated SEVKNOWN and DISCOUNT keywords.

3. Added parameters to the STRTECON keyword for discount rate, known SEV,
   and compute SEV “toggle” (turns SEV calculation on and off).The fields for
   the STRTECON keyword are:
   
STRTECON (ECON Start or Re-initialization Year)
Field 1: Year or cycle when economic calculations start.  If the ECON start-year
occurs after the first year of a cycle then harvests in that cycle will not be
included in ECON calculations, because FVS performs harvests in the first year
of each cycle.  Default = cycle 1.  

Field 2:  Percentage discount rate, greater than or equal to zero (e.g., 5.25).
Default = 0.

Field 3: Per acre dollar value of the known SEV; must be greater than zero.
Specifying a known SEV results in the calculation “value of forest”
(land plus standing harvestable timber) and “value of trees” (harvestable
timber separate from land).  If a value is entered in this field then SEV
will not be calculated, regardless of the value in Field 4, default = 0.  

Field 4: Compute the SEV for each cycle; turns the computation of SEV on and off.
This field only has affect if field 3 is blank or zero and the discount rate
is greater than zero; SEV is undefined for a zero discount rate.
0 = do not compute SEV, default.
1 = do compute SEV

4. Added smallest and largest tree DBH parameters to the HRVVRCST and
   PCTVRCST keywords to be consistent with thinning keywords when specifying
   diameter limits. The fields for the HRVVRCST are

HRVVRCST (Harvest Variable Cost)
Field 1:  Current (today’s) cost per unit-of-measure and tree DBH.  A zero cost is permitted.   

Field 2:  Unit-of-measure for which cost is specified.   This field is required or the keyword is ignored.  
1 = tree/acre harvested
2 = 1000 board-feet/acre
3 =   100 cubic-feet/acre

Field 3:  Smallest tree DBH in inches to which cost applies (greater than or equal).  Default=0.0

Field 4:  Largest tree DBH in inches to which cost applies (less than).  Default = 999.0

Field 5:  Enter an “&” (without quotes) if a supplemental record follows the keyword.

Supplemental Record:
Value rate changes are specified on the supplemental record and are entered as a rate and
duration pair.  The rate is entered as a percent change in the first five-character field
and the duration in years is entered in the next five-character field.  Rate must be greater
than or equal to -100%.  Up to eight rate/duration pairs can be entered on the
supplemental record.

The fields for the PCTVRCST keyword are
PCTVRCST (Pre-Commercial Thinning Variable Cost)

Field 1:  Current (today’s) cost per unit-of-measure and tree DBH.  

Field 2:  Unit-of-measure for which cost is specified.
This field is required or record is skipped.  
1 = tree/acre removed
2 = 1000 board-feet/acre
3 =   100 cubic-feet/acre

Field 3:  Smallest tree DBH in inches to which cost applies (greater
than or equal).  Default=0.0

Field 4:  Largest tree DBH in inches to which cost applies (less than).
 Default = 999.0

Field 5:  Enter an “&” (without quotes) if a supplemental record
follows the keyword.

Supplemental Record:
Value rate changes are specified on the supplemental record and are
entered as a rate and duration pair.  The rate is entered as a percent
change in the first five-character 

Impact on users:

Files:
./bin/makefile - Rebuilt Blue Mountains Climate link (FVSbmc) by creating new
                 folder and makefile for climate objects (bm/obj/makefile).
                 Updated bin/makefile.
./clim/bm/obj/makefile - see comments for bin/makefile
./common/ECNCOM.F77 deleted hrvCostDbhIndexm, pctDbhIndex, varHrvDbh, VarPctDbh
                    added doServ, varPctDbhLo, varPctDbhHi, varHrvDbhLo, varHrvDbhHi
