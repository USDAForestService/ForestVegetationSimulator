Variants affected: Central Rockies (CR), Tetons (TT), Utah (UT)

Description: 1) Updates the fuel model selection logic to correspond to the
             expanded species lists that are now available in the CR and UT variants,
             and will be available in the TT variant soon.
             
             CR variant: deleted the "juniper species", "cottonwood species", 
             and "oak species" genus groups; added new species Utah juniper,
             narrowleaf cottonwood, plains cottonwood, Gambel oak, Arizona white
             oak, Emory oak, bur oak, silverleaf oak, paper birch, alligator juniper,
             Rocky Mountain juniper, oneseed juniper, eastern redcedar, singleleaf
             pinyon, border pinyon, Arizona pinyon, and Chihuahua pine; moved blue
             spruce from the mixed conifer cover type to the spruce-fir cover type
             
             TT variant: added new species ponderosa pine, singleleaf pinyon, Utah
             juniper, Rocky Mountain juniper, bigtooth maple, Rocky Mountain maple,
             narrowleaf cottonwood, curlleaf mountain-mahogany, and "other hardwoods",
             changed "other species" to "other softwoods; added logic for the ponderosa
             pine and pinyon juniper cover types
             
             UT variant: moved blue spruce from the mixed conifer cover type to
             the spruce-fir cover type; added new species Great Basin bristlecone
             pine, narrowleaf cottonwood, Fremont cottonwood, curlleaf mountain-
             mahogany, bigtooth maple, boxelder and "other hardwoods"; changed 
             "oak species" to Gambel oak, changed "other species" to "other
             softwoods" 
             
             2) Deletion of obsolete code and other general code cleanup.

Impact on users: Users utilizing the Fuels and Fire Extension (FFE) in either the
                 CR or UT variants should obtain a new executable. Users of the TT
                 variant should wait until the 17 species version is released before
                 obtaining a new executable.

Files:

fire/ut/src  fmcfmd.f changed the date of revision; added changes noted above;
                      modified code structure to more closely match FVS coding
                      standards
                      
fvs/ut/src   habtyp.f changed date of revision, added comment about
                      parameter NR4 (this change occured in the previous revision
                      of the routine)

             sitset.f changed the date of revision; deleted obsolete code dealing
                      with resetting the default volume equation numbers for the
                      "other softwoods" species bin
                      
             varvol.f changed the date of revision; initialized the variable I0 to 0
                      in the initialization section before it is used in the call to 
                      R4VOL
                      
fvs/ni/src   vols.f   changed the date of revision; change lower case fortran code to
                      upper case (call to CALL) at line 423
                      
fvs/ci/src   crown.f  changed the date of revision; corrected spelling in a comment; 
                      reversed the order of lines 275-276.
