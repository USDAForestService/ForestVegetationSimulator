Subject:  Fire and Fuels Extension Update

Variants affected:
all variants with FFE (all variants except CS and AK)

Description:
1) A new estimation method for the torching index was implemented.  This fixes an
inconsistency with calculations that occured when multiple fuel models were being
used.  Torching index was also capped at 999 mi/hour.

2) The conditional surface fire type was changed to conditional crown fire.  This
was done to match the logic used in the NEXUS model.  Now, when conditional fires are
predicted, crown fire is assumed in the fire behavior and effects predictions, rather
than a surface fire.  The conditional crown fire type is represented by a "C" in the
potential fire report and "COND_CRN" in the burn conditions report and database extension
output.

Impact on users:
FFE users should obtain new executables.
