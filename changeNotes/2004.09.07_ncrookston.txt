Subject: Database extension enhancements

Description:

This notice modifies 2004.09.01_ncrookston.txt

1. Changed the input spacies code length to a maximum of 8, not 6 chars.

2. The new column in FVS_Cases table is now called Stand_CN. In the future
we will likely also have a Tree_CN so the name change will help us keep the
two items separate. And, the values of CN are 40 chars long, not 34.

3. Stand_CN is now a defined part of the FVS_StandInit table. When it is present
in the database, the value of Stand_CN from the database is used to initialize
the value of DBCN in FVS.  DBCN is stored in /PLOT/

4. Stand_CN can now be used in SQL preprocessing. For example, in addition to
%StandID% and other automatic variables, you can use %Stand_CN% in any SQL
statement in the database extension. The current value of CN will be inserted
in the SQL statement prior to processing.

5. Changed the new CN keyword to STANDCN.

Impact on users: User's will need to start fresh output databases because
of the change in CN column name in the FVS_Cases table.
