Subject:  Fire and Fuels Extension Update
Name: Stephanie Rebain	
Date: 08/14/2007
Variants affected:
all variants except CS and AK

Description:
1 - A correction was made to the processing of the TREEBIO event monitor function.
2 - A change was made to the processing of the CarbRept and CarbCut keywords so that the
    carbon reports can be conditionally scheduled in a way such that output is generated only
    for cycle boundaries.  Specifically, the keyword processing was adjusted to match that of
    PotFire and FuelOut.
3 - A bug was found in the Carbon Harvested Products report in which removed carbon was being
    allocated incorrectly in simulations longer than 100 years.  This was fixed with a temporary
    solution and may be adjusted again in the future.

Impact on users:
This affects users of the TREEBIO event monitor function and the FFE Carbon Reports.

Files:
fire/base/src/fmin.f - updated the processing of the CarbRept and CarbCut keywords to match PotFire and FuelOut
fire/base/src/fmdout.f - updated the processing of the CarbRept and CarbCut keywords to match PotFire and FuelOut
fire/base/src/fmchrvout.f - updated the processing of the CarbRept and CarbCut keywords to match PotFire and FuelOut
fire/base/src/fmevmon.f - made a correction to the TREEBIO function on line 808
ca/src/ecocls.f - changed the site species for 5 ecoclasses from SF to SH, since SF isn't a valid species 
                  code in this variant.  This should have no impact on users, but does impact debug.
