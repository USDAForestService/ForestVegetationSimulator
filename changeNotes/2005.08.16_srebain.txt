Subject: FFE update - new fuel models

Variants affected: All FFE variants

Description:
New fuel models (see RMRS-GTR-153, Scott and Burgan 2005) are available for selection with
the FuelModl keyword.
 
Impact on users:
This change gives users additional capabilities in terms of fuel model selection.

The new fuel models required that the live surface fuel category be divided into two - one for
live woody fuels and one for live herbaceous fuels.  This led to other changes on reports and 
keywords.  For instance, the potential fire report and burn conditions report now have an extra
output variable to account for this extra live category's moisture.  Also, some keywords such
as POTFMOIS, MOISTURE, and DEFULMOD were expanded to include additional necessary parameters.

Because the format of the potential fire report and burn conditions report changed slightly, 
some tools that read this table may not work properly, such as the fire and fuels post processor.
This tool will be updated shortly.

Also, the Database Extension FVS_BurnReport table was updated with an additional live fuel
moisture column and the previous live fuel moisture column was renamed.  As a result, you
will not be able to append new database output (associated with this table) to an excel worksheet
or access database table that was created with older code.

To use these new features thru the Suppose interface, you will need to download the latest version of
Suppose.  Care must be taken when running old keyword files with the new version of Suppose.  You will
have trouble editing certain keywords that were originally created with an older version of Suppose 
since new fields were added.  If editing old keyword files with the new version of Suppose, users should
delete the old versions of certain keywords (POTFMOIS, MOISTURE, DEFULMOD) and add them back in.

fire/base/src/fmfint.f - added debug code, adjusted the heat constent variable (LHV), and
                         adjusted the dead herb category to use the dead 1-hr fuel moisture
fire/base/src/fmburn.f - changed the processing of DEFULMOD keyword and changed 
                         calculation of INL, changed the processing of MOISTURE to account
                         for the new field
fire/base/src/fmin.f - changed processing of DEFULMOD keyword to account for 2 new parameters,
                       added fmkeydmp and fmkeyrdr so that I could have some FFE keywords
                       (PotFMois and Moisture) with 8 fields, added a new field for live herb
                       moisture onto the PotFMois and Moisture keywords

                         changed the format of the potential fire report so that the live herb
                         moisture is output
fire/base/src/fmfout.f - changed the format of the burn conditions report so that the live herb
                         moisture is output
