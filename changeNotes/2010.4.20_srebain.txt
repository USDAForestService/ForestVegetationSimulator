Description:
This adds a new option for Morris Johnson that allows him to adjust the foliar moisture content
for the fire behavior calculations.  Although this code will be in the repository, and part of the
production executables, I do not want to release it through a bulletin (i.e.  it will be a non-publicized
feature for the time being.)

Modified Files:
fire/base/common/FMCOM.F77 - created new variable, FOLMC, that holds the foliage moisture
                             content used in the fire behavior calculations.
fire/base/src/fmin.f - read in FOLMC on the CanCalc keyword
fire/base/src/fmcfir.f -  adjusted fire behavior calcs to use FOLMC
fire/base/src/fminit.f -  initialized FOLMC to 100%
fire/ppe/src/fmppput.f - added FOLMC
fire/ppe/src/fmppget.f - added FOLMC
