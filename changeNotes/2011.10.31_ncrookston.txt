Description: Replaced all the calls to the f90 sql library with calls 
to a C-language set of functions in fvsSQL.c

Impact on users: None

Files: All existing dbs files. In addition two new files have been 
created: 
  fvsSQL.c -- provides Fortran access to ODBC functions
  DBSTYPEDEFS.F77 -- provides for ODBC types and controlling functions.

Overview:
  A subset of of the Fortran callable ODBC functions are provided through
  a set of C-language functions. These replace all of the old f90sql subroutine
  calls. The new code was designed to conform as much as possible to the
  C-language ODBC API.
