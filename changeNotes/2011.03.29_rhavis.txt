Subject: R9 Clark Volume Eqs., Retirement of Twigs Models.
Name: R. Havis
Date: March 29, 2011
Variants affected: CS, LS, NE

Description:
1) The Region 9 TWIGS FVS variants have been replaced by the new R9 variants.
   Over the past several years users have had the option of using the 
   original R9 FVS variants that were based upon the TWIGS models, or the 
   new FVS variants that use more traditional FVS logic. The TWIGS-based
   FVS models will no longer be maintained.
   
2) Region 9 FVS variants have traditionally used the Gevorkiantz volume
   equations by default. The Region has converted to use of volume equations
   based on the work of Clark and others  The Clark volume equations are the
   new default equations in R9 FVS variants. The Gevorkiantz volume equations
   will continue to be available by setting Field 7 (volume calculation method)
   of the BFVOLUME and/or VOLUME keywords equal to 5.

Impact on users: All Region 9 users should obtain new executables.

Files:

Backing up local changes to files in your R9 variant directories is recommended before
updating.

The effect of replacing the R9 TWIGS variants with the new R9 variants, on the FVS
directory structure, was the deletion of the cs, ls, and ne directories, and the renaming
of the new R9 variant directories as follows.

rename cs_new to cs
rename ls_new to ls
rename ne_new to ne
rename ppne_new to ppne

Developers using the FMSC SVN repository should follow these instructions when
updating working copies.

1) SmartSVN and TortoiseSVN users - In the Update dialogue window select Advanced and check the 
   "Allow unversioned obstructions ("Force")" option.
   
2) After updating, manually delete the following directories from your working copy.
cs_new
ls_new
ne_new
ppne_new

3) Delete the objects in the following directories.
cs/obj
ls/obj
ne/obj

Files:

ak, bm, ca, cr, cs, dbs/so, em, ie, ne, ppne, sn, ppso/makefile - changed case /SO/ to /so/
cs, ls, ne/makefile - changed all references ??_new to ?? where ?? refers to cs, ls, and ne
                    - added compile instructions for EXPPNB, EXPPE, and MAIN
                    - removed compile instructions for EXDBS  

./ak/obj/makefile
./base/src/revise.f removed logic referring to the ??_new variants
bin/makefile - removed build instructions for TWIGS models
             - changed all references ??_new to ?? where ?? refers to cs, ls, and ne
             - removed references to TWIGS model build instructions
             - added R9CLARK, R9LOGS, DEBUG_MOD, CLKCOEF_MOD to R9 variant link lists
             - removed the ECON link lists for R9 builds - these objects are now linked
               through the list commands referencing variant-specific object directories
             - modified the PPLS and PPNE link lists to use updated objects
             - removed the allfire make group
             - commented out the allbase make group
             - modified comments
