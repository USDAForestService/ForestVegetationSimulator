Subject: Merch Height in Treelist Database Tables, and R9 Clark Volumes for the
         Southern Variant

Variants affected: ALL

Description: The R9 Clark volume equations were added to the SN variant for the
             Mark Twain and Shawnee NFs. Trees that do not meet DBH merch. specs
             have no reported Height To Merch. Top in the Treelist, Cutlist, and
             After Treatment Treelist output database tables. The default Height
             To Merch. Top columns in the database tables are defined as
             follows.

                           HT2TDCF                      HT2TDBF
             West          height to primary            height to primary
                           product(cubic feet)          product (board feet)


             East          height to pulp top           height to saw top

Impact on users: Users interested in height to Merch top output or in using
                 the southern variant to simulate stands in the Mark Twain or
                 Shawnee NFs should obtain new executables.
