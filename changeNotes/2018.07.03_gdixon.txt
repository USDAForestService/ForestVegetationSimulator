Description: These changes are part of a code modernization effort undertaken by the Forest Management 
             Service Center and follow guidelines suggested in the "FVS Code Modernization: Considerations and
             Recommendations" (Gary Dixon, Final Report, 05/25/2017). Changes included in this bulletin are
             changes to make the code more efficient and easier to maintain.

             Specifically:
             1. The array name BAU appeared in both the GGCOM and TWIGCOM labelled common blocks and with
                different dimensions. The BAU array in the TWIGCOM labelled common was changed to EBAU.

             2. Arrays containing site index range values for each species appeared in two places in the
                CI, SO, TT and UT variants. In each of these variants, the site index range values were 
                moved to one loction for ease of maintenance.

             3. Arrays containing site index range values for each species appeared in three places in the
                BM variant. Site index range values were moved to one location for ease of maintenance.
                
             4. Site index equation coefficients were being handled inefficiently. This has been improved.
                As part of these changes, an error was found in the the WF/GF equation used in both the OP 
                and PN variants. One of the coefficients was positive and should have been negative. This 
                was also corrected.

Impact on users: Generally no impact on users. Users of the OP and PN variants will notice a slight 
                 reduction in WF/GF height growth estimates and, in turn, volumes.
