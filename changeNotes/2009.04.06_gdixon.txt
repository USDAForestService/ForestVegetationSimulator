Subject: Automatic syncing of BA maximum with SDI maximum in the absence of a user-defined
         maximum BA value.

Variants affected: All variants

Description: As SDI maximum changes through time, the BA maximum is now set to a value
             consistent with the SDI maximum in the absence of a user-defined BA maximum
             value; if the user defines a BA maximum value, the user-defined maximum BA value 
             remains in effect from the time it is set until it is either reset or the end of 
             the simulation is reached.

common      VARCOM.F77     changed the date of revision; modified the definition of the LBAMAX 
                           variable so it now applies to all variants.
                           
base/src    sdical.f       changed the date of revision; added code to sync the BA maximum
                           with the SDI maximum if a user-defined BA maximum has not been 
                           entered.

dbs/src     dbsstandin.f   changed the date of revision; added setting of the LBAMAX variable 
                           to 1 if a non-zero BA maximum value was entered.
                           
ak/src      morts.f        changed the date of revision; took out the setting of variable TBAM1   
bm/src      morts.f        and removed it from the declaration list; replaced TBAM1 with BAMAX in

ci/src      morts.f        changed the date of revision; added a call to SDICAL to sync the
ie/src      morts.f        BA maximum with the SDI maximum if a user-defined BA maximum has
ni/src      morts.f        not been entered. Added changing the SDI upper and lower limits from a
wc/src      morts.f        percent to a proportion for bare ground plant runs
