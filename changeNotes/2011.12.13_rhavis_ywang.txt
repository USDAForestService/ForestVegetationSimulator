Description:

The Volume Estimator Library source code, which is used to calculate tree
volumes in FVS, has been updated by the Measurements group (measurements 
bulletin V0158_121211).  The updates do not affect FVS volume calculations 
except when there are numerical errors. Region 4 and 9 routines were updated 
to trap numerical errors when excessively tall trees are passed from FVS. 
When these errors occur, the tree volume is set to zero and an error code 
is returned to FVS.

Impact on users: Numerical error checking in the volume code will potentially
                 prevent FVS model runtime errors in Regions 4 and 9.
