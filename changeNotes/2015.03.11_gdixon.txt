Subject: Revamping the two FVS-Organon variants for production use
Name: Gary Dixon
Date: 03/11/15
Variants affected: CACOR (now OC) and PNCOR (now OP)

Description: Incorporation of the ORGANON growth model into FVS was initially done by Jeff Hammond. The Organon 
Southwest Oregon model type was incorporated into the CA variant and called CACOR; The Northwest Oregon and Stand
Management Co-op model types were incorporated into the PN variant and called PNCOR. This effort did not result in
variants useful for production processing. The resulting code is now being revamped to eliminate errors, make 
available the full array of FVS processing options, and make the code conform to established code standards for ease
of maintainence and updating.

As part of this update, and in keeping with the two character alpha codes as variant identifiers, CACOR will now be
known as the OC variant and PNCOR the OP variant.

base/src
     keywds.f  modified to be consistent with the trunk version of this subroutine (i.e. moved the ORGANON keyword
               to position 143 and put the PTGROUP keyword in position 142)
     initre.f  added code to ORGANON keyword processing to write an error message and return if the variant identifier
               was not either OC or OP; moved the setting of the IY( ) array to subroutine GRINIT; removed the call
               to subroutine ORINIT
     revise.f  added OC and OP variants
  exorganon.f  removed entry ORINIT

ni/src
     spctrn.f  added OC and OP variants (duplicated CA and PN mapping for now with the exception of changing 4 = WF
               to 4 = GF in the CA variant, and mapping WF to GF in this routine)
