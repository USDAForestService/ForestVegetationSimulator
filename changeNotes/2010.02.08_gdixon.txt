Subject: small tree diameter growth for aspen (AS) and other (OT)

Name: Gary Dixon
Date: 02/08/10

Variants affected: Tetons (TT)

Description: The Tetons variant used the smdgf routine from the
             Eastern Montana variant. The Eastern Montana variant was
expanded from 8 to 19 species in March 2009. Changes to the EM smdgf
routines as part of that expansion, caused zero diameter growth estimates
for all aspen (AS) and other (OT) trees less than 3.0" in dbh in the
Tetons variant. This problem went undetected between March 2009 and now. 

Impact on users: All users of the Tetons (TT) variant should obtain a 
                 new executable.

tt/src     SMDGF  This is a new routine which corresponds to the old
                  eastern Montana version before the EM species expansion
                  project.
                  
tt/obj  makefile  Added compile instructions for the new SMDGF routine

bin     makefile  Changed to link the SMDGF routine from the tt/obj object
                  directory for all versions of the TT variant instead of 
                  linking this routine from the em/obj object directory:
                  1) added smdgf to the TT_LINK list
                  2) removed ${EM_OBJ}smdgf.o${BJ}  \  from the link instructions
                     for FVStt, FVSttc, FVSttb, and FVSttx
