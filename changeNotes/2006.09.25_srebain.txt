Subject: Fire and Fuels Extension Update - NI, EM, and IE variants
Name:  Stephanie Rebain

Description:
The way crown width / canopy cover was computed within FFE was updated for the NI, EM, and IE variants
so that it matches the way it is computed in other parts of FVS.  

Impact on users:
FFE users of the NI, IE, and EM variants should download new executables.

Modified Files:
fire/ni/src/fmcba.f - changed the way crown width was calculated to use the CRWDTH 
                      array rather than a call to ccfcal.
fire/ie/src/fmcba.f - changed the way crown width was calculated to use the CRWDTH 
                      array rather than a call to ccfcal.
fire/em/src/fmcba.f - changed the way crown width was calculated to use the CRWDTH 
                      array rather than a call to ccfcal.
