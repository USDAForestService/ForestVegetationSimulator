Description: When a tree attribute is not in the input database (like HT), it
was not being initialized correctly. If the column was present, but had zeros
or nulls, there was no problem. Only if it was missing completely. The the fix
was to initialize all attributes prior to the calles to bind data.

Impact on users:
Users with more than one stand in a run, using the dbsqlite programs, that use
non-standard input data bases should rerun their simulations.
