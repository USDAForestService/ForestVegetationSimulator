Name: Robert Havis
Date: 12 March 2004
Variants affected: PPE (with mistletoe), FFE, IE

Files and Description:

bin/MAKEFILE  - added ${OBJ} string to the objects in IE_BASE_ADD to allow compilation on PC
base/EXDBS    - dimensioned 3 arrays for consistency with subroutine call statements
mistoe/MSPPPT, MSPPGT - in reading and writing the integer array ISMSOUT, the IFWRIT routine
must be used rather than the BFWRIT routine
fire/nc/FMCFMD - added actual argument to the CWHR call statement for consistency with
the CWHR subroutine statement arguments.

Impact on users: There should not be a noticible effect.
