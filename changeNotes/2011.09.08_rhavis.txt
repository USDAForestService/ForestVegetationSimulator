Variants affected: ALL

Description:

1. There was a problem writing the FVS_Hrv_Carbon table to a generic
   database. This has been corrected

2. The FIA codes, and NRCS PLANTS symbols, for the species categories shown
   below were represented by dashes (---). This caused volumes to be
   calculated using softwood equations. The new codes, listed below,
   are mapped to hardwood volume equations.

Impact on users: Users who write the FVS_Hrv_Carbon table to a generic
                 database should obtain a new executable. Region 9 users
                 should obtain a new executable.
