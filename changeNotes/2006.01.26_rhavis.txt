Subject: KEYWORD FILE NAME ECHO TO OUTPUT FILE, DELOTAB KEYWORD CONTROL
         OF ACTIVITY SCHEDULE TABLE, AND KEYWORD ECHO CONTROL

Name: Robert Havis
Date: January 26, 2006
Variants affected: ALL

Description:
1) The name of the keyword file used in a simulation has been added to the
   main output file within the OPTIONS SELECTED BY INPUT table header.
2) An option (4) has been added to the DELOTAB keyword to suppress
   writing the ACTIVITY SCHEDULE table to the main output table.

   DELOTAB    (DELete Output TABles)
   Field 1:   Code for table that is to be deleted. Default = blank (no tables deleted)
              1 = delete the stand composition table
              2 - delete the selected sample tree table
              3 = delete the summary statistics table
              4 = delete the activity schedule table

3) FVS echos the keyword information, read on input, to the OPTIONS SELECTED
   BY INPUT table in the main output file. Two new base model keywords, described below,
   have been introduced to allow the user to turn the keyword echo off
   (NOECHO) and to turn it back on (ECHO). By default, keyword echo is ON (ECHO).
   In a serial run, keyword echo returns to the default condition after processing
   each stand. The number of keyword records processed, and not echoed to the
   main output file, is reported. Warning and error messages and the Parallel
   Processing Extension (PPE) keywords are not affected by the NOECHO keyword.
   
   ECHO      (Default) Echo keywords to the OPTIONS SELECTED BY INPUT TABLE
   There are no fields
   
   NOECHO    Suppresses keyword echo to the OPTIONS SELECTED BY INPUT TABLE
   There are no fields

Impact on users: Users who need the output control capabilities described above
                 should obtain a new executable.


FILES AFFECTED:

The keyword write statements were edited to be conditional on the LKECHO logical varible,
which is passed as a subroutine argument from the INITRE routine. LKECHO is set using
the ECHO and NOECHO keywords.
