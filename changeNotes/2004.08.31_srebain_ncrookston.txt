Subject:  Corrections to FFE Calculations
Name: Stephanie Rebain and Nick Crookston
Date: 08/31/2004
Variants affected:  All FFE variants

Description: FFE bombed in some cases when moisture levels were set so 
high that potential or simulated fires couldn't actually burn.  This was 
fixed.  In these cases, the torching and crowning indices will be 
reported as -1.  Also, some internal variables weren't being initialized
correctly and this was fixed as well.  The torching index was capped at 
9999 miles/hour.

Impact on users:  Most users will notice no difference in output.  There
may be a difference in simulations where moisture levels are set high.  
If FFE bombed in these cases previously, it may not with the current 
code.  There may be a difference in torching index, in situations where 
it was previously very high.

Files:
fvs/fire/base/src/fmcfir.f - added error traps for divide by zero errors.
Also, capped the torching index at 9999.
fvs/fire/base/src/fmfint.f - initialized some variables to zero at the 
beginning of a loop.
fvs/fire/base/src/fmpofl.f - added error trapping to avoid log 0 errors.
made a change to when conditional surface fires are reported, taking 
into account the fact that the crowning index may be -1.
