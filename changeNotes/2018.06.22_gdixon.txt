Variants affected: All variants

Description: These changes are part of a code modernization effort undertaken by the Forest Management 
             Service Center and follow guidelines suggested in the "FVS Code Modernization: Considerations and
             Recommendations" (Gary Dixon, Final Report, 05/25/2017). Changes included in this bulletin are
             to improve the code repository directory structure, seperate subroutines containing variant-
             specific coding from those that don't, and restructure the way the variant designator is set,
             passed, and used throughout the model.

             Specifically:
             1. New subdirectories were created to contain variant-specific code, subroutines containing 
                variant-specific code were moved into the new subdirectories.
             2. The new 2-character variable VARACD was created in the CONTRL labelled COMMON block to
                contain the variant designator. The VARVER entry points in all the GROHED subroutines
                was elimintated. The 7-character variable VVER was eliminated throughout the model.

             3. In the process of implementing the VARACD variable, errors were discovered in the Central
                Rockies variant sprouting logic. The errors affect the number of aspen sprouts, and the
                sprout heights for all sprouting species. These errors have been corrected.

Impact on users: Directory structure changes, and improvements to the way the variant designator is set and
                passed throughout the model only affect FVS developers; there is no impact on users. However,
                corrections to the Central Rockies sprouting logic will impact any users making runs of stands
                containing sprouting species.

            CONTRL.F77  The variable VARACD was added to carry the 2-character alphabetic variant designator.
                        All variable names were alphabetized. The file was restructured in the desired format.

                        deleted for variables that have been previously removed from this labelled common
                        block. The unused variables D0 and D0MULT were deleted.
