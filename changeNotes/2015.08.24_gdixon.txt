Subject: Code cleanup: removal of LAKEVIEW in comment lines
Name: Gary Dixon
Date: 08/24/15
Variants affected: WC

Description: Forest code 711 is for BLM's Medford Administrative Unit. It was wrongly stated in some comment lines
             as Medford/Lakeview. Lakeview ADU has its own code to be added at a future date, so LAKEVIEW was purged
             from comment statements where it appeared. 

Impact on users: None. This is a cosmetic change in the code.
