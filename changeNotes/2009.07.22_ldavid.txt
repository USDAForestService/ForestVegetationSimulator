Variants affected: KT

Description:
Had created Climate Extension links for Eastern variants noted in 
2009.04.08_ldavid.txt for CS, LS, NE and SN that were invalid, they were
removed from the bin\makefile and associated folders under \fvs\clim also were
removed. Climate Extension link for KT variant was not created in April and so 
added to the bin\makefile this time. KT is a 11 specie variant and uses the
clim\base\obj files, so no "kt" folder exists under fvs\clim.

1) Invalid folders under "clim" removed.

2) fvs\bin\makefile edited for Climate Extension linkage with KT variant.
   Link instructions for CS, LS, NE and SN removed. Make target "allclimate"
   will generate all available executables with ECON, FFE and CLIMate extensions.
   NOTE: Climate extension executable for NI variant not created.
 
   Current CLIMate extension executables are:
	FVSakc 
	FVSbmc 
	FVScac 
	FVScic 
	FVScrc 
	FVSecc 
	FVSemc 
	FVSiec 
	FVSktc 
	FVSncc 
	FVSpnc 
	FVSso33c - if following current distribution convention, this would be
	           distributed FVSsoc.exe
	FVSttc 
	FVSutc 
	FVSwcc 


Impact on users:
No users. Climate Extension is not released.

Modified Files:
bin\makefile  - linking instructions added for KT variant to include Climate 
                Extension (FVSktc.exe). Climate link for Eastern variants removed.
