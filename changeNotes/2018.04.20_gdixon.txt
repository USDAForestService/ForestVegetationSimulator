Subject: SN denormal error
         SO height growth problem
         Referencing undefined variables

Name: Gary Dixon

Variants affected: All variants

Description: The SN variant, although running to completion, was showing a denormal error. This was traced to
             variables in the volume logic that were being referenced without being defined in all cases. This 
             problem has been fixed.
             
             The SO variant was blowing up in runs that had tree records taller than the height at which the
             species site index curve topped out. This problem has been fixed.
             
             All variants contained one or more of the following subroutines in which undefined variable
             references were fixed.

Impact on users: All users should obtain a new executable.

                 the site index curve has flattened off.

         htgf.f  Initialization of the variable HGUESS was moved to the tree loop since it is a tree-level variable.
