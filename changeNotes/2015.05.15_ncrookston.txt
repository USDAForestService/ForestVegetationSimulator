Subject: Add FMortMlt keyword to FFE
Name: Nick Crookston

Variants affected: All

Description:
Routine changes needed to support the keyword, see Files. The new keyword
abstract is: 
FMortMlt   
Field 1: Year/Cycle
Field 2: Multiplier
Field 3: Species (0 = ALL), 
Field 4: Lower DBH (trees must be GE this)
Field 5: Upper DBH (trees must be less than this). 
      
Impact on users: None unless the new keyword is used

Files:
base/src/oplist.f - added activity code 2554 to the tables
fire/base/common/FMCOM.F77 - added a vector to hold the multiplier so that 
 it is used in the potential fire as well as the simulated fire calculations
fire/base/common/FMFCOM.F77 - just a tab fix
fire/base/src/fmeff.f - added code to apply the multiplier
fire/base/src/fmin.f - added keyword processing
fire/base/src/fmmain.f - added option processing. the multiplier is reset to 
 1.0 at the beginning of every cycle, so it does not have "history" and therefore
 does not need to be record tripled nor stored in put/get routines
tests/FVSiec/iet03.key - added the use of the new keyword to a test
tests/FVSiec/iet03.sum.save - updated the test output
