Subject: Bug Fixes
Name: R. Havis
Date: November 21, 2006
Variants affected: CA, IE, SO, and WS and all FFE extensions

Description:
1) The default habitat type assignment correction (please reference FVS Update
   Bulletin) was completed for the CA variant
2) The max and Min site index bounds for the other hardwoods species were
   updated to correspond with the values in the central rockies variant from
   which the species was imported. Changed the maximum site form 120 to 100
   and changed the minimum site index from 0 to 20. (IE)
3) The crown ratio term in the crown modifier part of the small tree height
   growth function for red shasta fir was being divided by 10 rather than 100. (SO)
4) The small tree height growth adjustment for Jeffry pine was applied twice,
   so the second adjustment was removed. (WS)
5) Corrected problem with root decay.


Impact on users: Users of these variants should obtain new executables.
