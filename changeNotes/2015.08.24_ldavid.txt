Description: Western Root Disease model modified to function with FVS 
             FVS stop/restart capabilities. During this process a few errors
             and oversites in the base system were addressed as well. Those
             modifications involved activities, reports and database output
             that did not continue upon restart of a FVS run. One new file
             associated with the stop/restart that a user will notice in the
             working directory at a FVS stop point will include _RegenRpt.txt
             in the name. This is a temporary file for the Establishment Model
             reports and will be deleted upon successful execution of a
             restart.
             Updated the Western Root Disease model to use the General Report
             Writer facility and to send output disease summary and reports
             (summary, detailed, and bark beetle mortality) to a output
             database. A correction was made to the bark beetle mortality
             report where stand level TPA mortality was not properly weighted
             to represent diseased stand area and uninfected stand area as a
             total stand area mortality TPA value.
             
             This update includes the addition of three new Database Extension
             keywords: RDSum, RDBBMort, RDDetail.

             Root disease summary and bark beetle mortality reports used to
             have options to generate seperate external text files. The option
             to send these reports directly to the output database has replaced
             capability.

Impact on users: Users may notice that the oder of some reports in the main
                 output file has changed. This is due to the implementation of
                 the General Report Writer facility assigning a sequence ID to
                 reports based on the point in time that the first record is 
                 written to individual reports.
