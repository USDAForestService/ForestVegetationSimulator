Subject: FFE Restructuring update
Name:  Stephanie Rebain
Date:  09/09/2014
Variants affected: All

Description:

1)  With the last software release, the reporting interval field on many FFE report keywords,
such as POTFIRE, FUELOUT, CARBREPT, CARBCUT, DWDCVOUT, DWDVLOUT, CANFPROF, and SNAGOUT, did not
operate properly.  As a result, this field was removed.  Simultaneously, many FFE report
keywords (POTFIRE, FUELOUT, CARBREPT, CARBCUT, DWDCVOUT, DWDVLOUT, CANFPROF, BURNREPT, FUELREPT,
MORTREPT, SOILHEAT) were simplied so that a starting year and reporting duration are no longer entered. 
Reported output will always be on cycle boundary years for these output tables.
