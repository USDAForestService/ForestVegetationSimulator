Subject: Expansion of the CR variant from 24 species to 38 species


Name: Gary Dixon
Date: 07/06/09

Variants affected: Central Rockies

Description: At the request of Regions 2 and 3, the Central Rockies variant
             was expanded from recognizing 24 species to recognizing 38 species.


Impact on users: No impact on growth projections for the current 24 species. 
                 However, users wanting to take advantage of the expanded species
                 list should obtain a new variant executable.

Files:
cr/common    PRGPRM.F77   changed the date of revision; changed MAXSP from 24 to 38         
             ESCOMN.F77   changed the date of revision; corrected IFORST from 20 to 23;
                          corrected OCURNF from (20,MAXSP) to (23,MAXSP)
             ESPARM.F77   changed the date of revision; changed NSPSPE from 3 to 11
             
the following variant specific files changed to accomodate the species expansion:

                       default to the Boise/Payette for cover computation when
                       the extension is being used outside the range for which
                       it is calibrated.
