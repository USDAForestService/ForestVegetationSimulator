Description:

SPLEAVE (SPecies LEAVE)
Variants: All
Related keywords: NONE
Allows species to be excluded from scheduled harvesting actions.
If the leave-status is True for any trees within the specified limits
for harvest, the residual will be greater than the target residual
because of the trees left.

field 1: Year or cycle that the keyword is to go into effect. Default = 1

field 2: Species or species group whose leave-status is to be changed.
A valid code is required or the keyword is ignored.

field 3: Flag indicating the leave-status of the species in field 2.
         (default=1)
Flag <= 0 the species leave-status is False, species is eligible for harvesting
Flag >  0 the species leave-status is True

Note: For any particular species or species group this keyword remains in
effect until a subsequent use of the keyword changes the leave-status.

Note: Keyword order may be important. If a SPLEAVE keyword is specified for
the same year that a thinning keyword is specified, the species leave-status will
affect the thinning only if the SPLEAVE keyword appears in the keyword sequence
before the thinning keyword.

Note: The PARMS format may be used with this keyword. See the introduction
for a description of this format.
