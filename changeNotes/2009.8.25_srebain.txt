Variants affected: All

Description:
1)  An improvement was made to the FuelModl keyword.  In previous versions, when a nonexistent
    fuel model number was entered, FVS would stop mid-simulation.  Now, when this occurs, if 
    the fuel model entered is greater than 30, the FuelModl keyword is "Not Done" and the 
    simulation continues using the default fuel model selection logic.  Since a custom fuel model
    may be defined with a fuel model number <= 30, simulations will not change if a nonexistent
    fuel model number is entered that is less than or equal to 30.  
    
Impact on users:
Simulations that may have ended mid-simulation before will now run.
