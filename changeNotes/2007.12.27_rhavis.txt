Subject: ATRTLIST Keyword - After Treatment Tree List Table
Name: R. Havis
Date: December 27, 2007
Variants affected: ALL

Description: The new ATRTLIST keyword generates a new output table showing the
             tree list after a stand has received a scheduled treatment. By
             default the standard file output for the After Treatment Tree
             List Table is the .tls file. The data base table name is
             FVS_ATRTList.


ATRTList (After Treatment Tree List file)
         Variants: All
         Related keywords: TREELIST, CUTLIST, OPEN
         Prints a list of tree records representing stand conditions after a
         scheduled treatment to an output treelist file.

field 1: Year or cycle in which treelist is to be printed.
         Enter 0 (zero) to print output for every cycle. Default = 1
field 2: File reference number for the output file. File reference numbers
         are a mechanism that FVS uses to keep track of external files.
         Numbers less than 30 are reserved for files that are currently
         used by FVS. Default = 3
field 3: Value to determine which header will be printed with the treelist.
         Default = 0
              1 Encoded header record (machine readable, -999)
              0 Header records describing each column (human readable)
             -1 Suppress all headers
field 4: Cycle 0/1 treelist printing flag. This field is ignored unless
         field 1 represents the first cycle of the simulation (i.e. field 1 = 1,
         or field 1 = first year of simulation). Default = 0
              0 Print both cycle 0 and cycle 1
              1 Print only cycle 1
              2 Print only cycle 0 (beginning of simulation)
field 5: Not used
field 6: Value to determine if output will be in old format. Default = 0
              0 Print in standard format
            > 0 Print in old format
