Subject: Modified the API so that C functions can be used to pass character data
Name: Nick Crookston
Date: 2019.09.09
Variants affected: All

Description: The rules for passing character data between C-language programs and 
Fortran have changed in the most recent versions of Fortran. A new set of C routines
in file base/apisubsc.c (added) provides a set of API routines that are designed
to be called from C. Those API routines that do not pass character strings are not
affected. The changes are downward compatable as the older fortran interfaces were not
changed and in many cases are called from C using modified arguments.

This change is made to only affect the "Q-family" at this time. Making it apply to 
the ODBC-based programs would only require modifying the sourceList files for those 
programs.

Impact on users: None except that users of rFVS using R version 3.6.1 will not see
warnings and future versions should work.
