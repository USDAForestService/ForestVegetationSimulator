Name: R. Havis
Date: March 3, 2008
Variants affected: ALL

Description:

1) Added code to delete tree records with zero prob values as a result
of previous cycle mortality, or those marked for deletion by other
parts of the model.

2) The SN variant default stand density values are based on Forest Type.
When calculated Forest Type changes during a simulation, the Stand Density
Index (SDIMAX) value is dynamically reset to a new default value
based on the calculated Forest Type. The Stand density specified
by the SDIMAX or BAMAX keywords does not change during a simulation. In the SN variant,
when calculated Forest Type resets, and the BAMAX keyword was used, the calculated
SDIMAX value was not adjusted to the proportion (default = 0.85) of the 
theoretical maximum density at which the stand reaches actual maximum density.
This has been corrected.

3) Changed industry (701) to default to R5 rather than R6 for a default
habitat type. This is for consistency with other parts of the model.

4) Retired the Southeast variant from the production source code.

5) Several report generation controlling variables were relocated to the
MISCOM common block and became stand-specific variables in PPE (added to
the put and get routines). This resolves a newly discovered issue in PPE
simulations where the top 4 most dwarf mistletoe infected species were
reselected during the simulation causing the table headings not to match
the values in the columns.

Impact on users: Obtain new executables

Files:

Retired SE variant deleting source code and references,
renamed SECOM.F77 to SNCOM.F77 and completed this rename in the SN 
source code and throughout the makefiles

Changes to Mistletoe routines are described in changeNotes/2008.03.10_ldavid.txt
