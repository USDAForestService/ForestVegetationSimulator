Subject: Volume Update, R9 Large Tree Height Growth
Name: R. Havis
Date: February 8, 2013
Variants affected: CS, LS, and NE

Description:

1) Height growth in the Region 9 variants is calculated using site
index curves and when tree height reaches the asymptotic maxima of the curve,
height growth is reduced to 0.1 foot per cycle. There was a problem where
the the height increment calculated for the previous tree in the tree list
was being added to the height of trees having heights above the maximum
calculated by the site curve. This has been corrected.

2) There were changes to the volume code, but they do not affect FVS simulations.
