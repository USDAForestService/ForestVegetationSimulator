Variants affected: All WWPBM Extensions

Description: WWPBM-DB-SVS output changes.
         (1) old WWPBM output generating keywords are now obsolete.
         (2) standard (PPE "top component") WWPBM output has been 
               reduced from 5 files to 2; these contain new information.
         (3) 4 new WWPBM output files containing additional data are now
               available as stand-level schedulable activities 
         (4) data from these four new output files may now be redirected 
               to a database
         (5) WWPBM beetle-killed trees are now uniquely portrayed in SVS.
             
         (6) PPE change: Progress of a PPE run is now written to screen
             
     Details:

(1 & 2) WWPBM keywords BMTOTALS, BMDETAIL and BMDVOUT are now obsolete.
Two of the output files previously requestable via keyword BMTOTALS are
now available via keyword BMOUT: the "landscape average" (*.lpy) output file
and the "cycle" (*.cyc) output file.  Unlike its predecessor, the new cycle
output file now reports cycle-beginning values (and some cycle total values) 
instead of cycle-average values.  Contents of both files have been enhanced.

Keyword BMOUT has 2 fields.  The default condition is that they are both 
blank, which invokes both output files to be written.  Any value in field 1 
suppresses the *.lpy output file; any value in field 2 suppresses the *.cyc
output file.

(3 & 4) A new stand level WWPBM option processor (BMIN) was created.  It 
processes *STAND LEVEL* WWPBM keywords.  It is invoked via (new) base-FVS 
keyword BMIN, which signals that stand-level WWPBM keywords are to be 
read-in. 
The new stand-level options (currently available) are for 4 different 
output files. Each output file may be redirected to database using new 
database keywords.  

The new keywords & files are:
                                             
----------------------------------------------------------
                                                ASSOCIATED
KEYWORD   OUTPUT FILE                   UNIT    DB KEYWORD
----------------------------------------------------------
MAINOUT   "Main"                         26     PPBMMAIN 
TREEOUT   tree-by-size class             27     PPBMTREE
BKPOUT    BKP & RV                       28     PPBMBKP
VOLOUT    volume-by-size class           30     PPBMVOL

Keyword fields:
Field 1: year (or cycle) to begin writing
Field 2: Duration to write (# of years)
Field 3: Interval (within the duration period) to write (years)

Database keyword fields:
Field 1: A value greater than one suppresses the standard output file (i.e. 
data will be written to database only).  A blank or a value of 1 invokes  
both the writing to DB as well as standard output file.

(5) WWPBM-SVS modifications

In runs invoking both SVS and the WWPBM, 80-series tree class codes are 
written to the SVS files, allowing simulated beetle-killed trees to be 
portrayed uniquely, e.g. as "red trees".  New treeform files, recognizing 
the new tree class codes, are under development.

(6) PPE: echo progress to screen as run progresses (PPMAIN) 

Now, instead of a seeing a "blank" screen, the user sees something like:
 
    STAND  xx  OF xxxx    CYCLE  x  OF  xx   1ST LOOP 

scroll by on the screen as the run progresses.


Impact on users:

Users running keyword sets invoking WWPBM output-generating keywords 
BMTOTALS, BMDETAIL, or BMDVOUT will need to change their keyword files.  
Although keyword BMTOTALS will not invoke the writing of the three output 
files that it heretofore did, it will still invoke output writing; its 
request will be "redirected" to keyword BMOUT.  Thus, an old BMTOTALS 
request will invoke the writing of the new *.bml and *.bmc output files.

The WWPBM mapping tools (ArcView 3.x projects) will not be updated to 
accomodate these new output files.  These WWPBM mapping tools are thus 
rendered obsolete.  Users will need to employ new methods enabling 
importation of WWPBM output data into a GIS.
