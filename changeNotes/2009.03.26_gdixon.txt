Variants affected: Eastern Montana (EM)

Description: This variant was expanded from 8 species to 19 species. Equations and coefficients for
             the additional species are from the IE variant but have their roots in the CR, NI, TT,
             and UT variants. Additional species and their IE surrogate equation are:
               a)limber pine <-- use IE limber pine which originated from the TT variant
               b)subalpine larch <-- use IE subalpine fir which originated from the NI variant
               c)Rocky Mtn juniper <-- use IE Rocky Mtn juniper which originated from the UT variant
               d) quaking aspen <-- use IE quaking aspen which originated from the UT variant
               e) paper birch <-- use IE paper birch which generally uses the IE aspen equations
               f) green ash, black cottonwood, balsam poplar, plains cottonwood, narrowleaf cottonwood,
                  and other hardwoods <-- use IE cottonwood which originated from the CR variant.
                  
             This expansion includes components associated with FVSem.exe (base model, full
             regeneration establishment model, cover, dwarf mistletoe, econ, and ffe). It does
             not include additional components associated with FVSemx.exe (Douglas-fir beetle,
             Douglas-fir tussock moth, mountain pine beetle, root disease, and budworm).

Impact on users: Users should obtain a new executable.  Results for projections of the original 8
                 species in this variant are unchanged.
