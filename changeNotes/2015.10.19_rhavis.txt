Subject: FFE Processing Snag Heights on input from FVS
Name: R. Havis
Date: October 19, 2015
Variants affected: ALL

Description: When snags having a broken top were added to the Fire and Fuels (FFE)
             snag list, the total tree height was not available to parametrize the profile
             volume equations. This has been corrected. 

Impact on users: The volumes of truncated snags in the FFE model could be in
                 error when snags having broken tops were present in the
                 FVS input tree list.
