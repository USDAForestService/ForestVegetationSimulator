Subject:  Corrections to Random Number Calls in FFE Fuel Model Logic
Name:  Stephanie Rebain 
Date:  2004/08/20
Variants affected:  SOFM, BMFM

Description:  In the SO and BM variants, random numbers are used in the
fuel model logic.  These calls to the RANN subroutine affected the
random number sequence.  As a result, simply requesting the Potential 
Fire Report would change your base FVS output (TPA, BA, VOLUME).  This
was changed so that the random number sequence was not disturbed.

Impact on users:  Users may notice small changes in base FVS and
FFE output.

                     calls to the Rann subroutine would not disrupt the
