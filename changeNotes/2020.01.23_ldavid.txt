Variants affected: CI variant

Description: Variable RD needed for aspen calculation at line 754 had not
             been loaded resulting in a floating point error on some systems.
             Also corrected failing debug write statement.

Impact on users: Growth impacts of small aspen would be expected but not shown
                 in base tests datasets.
