Subject: Root Disease Model Update, FFE Snag Report, Command line Processing

Variants affected: All variants

Description: Western Root Disease model updated to reduce redundant code.
             Variant-specific routines for processing keywords existed due to
             formatted reading of supplemental records to accommodate varying
             number of species. Those reads have been changed to unformatted
             which eliminated 13 versions of rdin.f. Additionally, construction
             of supplemental records by the user is much easier because the 
             supplemental values are free-form and can span as many lines or 
             records needed. Only need to make sure that one value exists for
             every species represented by the variant. 

             Necessary modifications where made so that the FFE Snag Report
             generates its own file, as originally intended with the extension
             .sng (and unit 35) instead of sharing unit 13 with calibration
             statistics and CHEAPO output.

             When running FVS with command line options, the keyword file name
             was not being stored so that it was available for automatically
             generating other output file names by adding appropriate extension
             like .trl and .sng for output treelist and FFE Snag output.

Impact on users: Users will not experience changes in the output and Root
             Disease Model keyword and kcp files will continue to work, but
             the strict formatting of supplemental records on keywords is no
             longer required.
             
             When the user requests snag output with the SnagOut keyword, a
             file having the same name as their run and keyword files will be
             generated with file extension ".sng".

Files:

base/src/cmdline.f - Modified to store keyword file name from command line
         filopn.f    option for use in created other file names needed for run.

lpmpb/src/mpbinit.f - Removed obsolete open of unit 20.

rd/src/rdin.f     - Processing of supplemental records for multiple keywords
                    changed to unformatted and other code clean-up for ease of
                    reading only.
