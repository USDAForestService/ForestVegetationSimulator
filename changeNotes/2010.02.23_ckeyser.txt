Subject: Southern Variant Ecoregion Update.
Name: C. Keyser
Date: February 23, 2010
Variants affected: SN

Description: 

Ecoregion processing now accepts 2007 eco-unit codes (subsection level)
in addition to the 1995 eco-unit codes. 

When reading an input database a user may enter eco-unit codes in the 
"Ecoregion" or "Habitat/PV_Code" fields. The value in the "Ecoregion" field 
over-rides what is in the "Habitat/PV_Code" field. This only occurs 
with the Southern variant.

Please refer to the variant overview documentation for new eco-unit codes.

Impact on users: Users should obtain new executables.
