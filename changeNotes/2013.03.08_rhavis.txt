Subject: Forest Codes, ThinRDSL, and ThinPt
Name: R. Havis

Variants affected: ALL

Description:

1) CR variant: Updated to map the Routt NF Forest Code (211) to the
               Medicine Bow-Routt (206)and also updated the default
               forest code for model types 4 and 5 to 206 instead of
               previous 211.
               
2) NE variant: The ThinRDSL keyword may be used only in the northeast
               variant for certain SILVA forest types (see the FVS Keyword
               Guide for further information). The thin from below and
               thin from above options were not working. This has been
               corrected. 

3) All variants: The ThinPt keyword may be used to thin individual points in a stand. The
                 options to thin points to a residual Stand Density Index (SDI), Curtis
                 relative density, and Silva relative density were not working.
                 This has been corrected. 

Impact on users: To use the ThinRDSL thin from above and thin from below
                 options obtain a new executable. To use the ThinPt
                 keyword to thin points to residual SDI, Curtis relative
                 density or SILVA relative density obtain a new variant.
