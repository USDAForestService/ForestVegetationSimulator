Name: R. Havis
Date: 11 Nov 04
Variants affected: FFE extensions to the CA, CR, NC, PN, SN, WC, SO, TT variants

Description: The dependencies listed in the FFE makefiles were reviewed and modified as described below.

Files:

bin/makefile - added fire_ni_compile to FVSsofm, FVSsox, FVSttfm, and FVSttx build instructions
fire/ca/obj/makefile - deleted duplicate dependencies in FMSVFL compile instructions
fire/cr/obj/makefile - added ESHAP to ni/FMCONS dependency list, organized compile list
fire/nc/obj/makefile - removed EMCOM, added FMFCOM to FMCBA dependency list,
                       added PLOT to FMVINIT dependency list
fire/pn/obj/makefile - added SSTGMC to FMCFMD dependency list
                       deleted duplicate dependencies in FMSSEE compile instructions
                       deleted duplicate dependencies in FMSVFL compile instructions
fire/ppe/obj/makefile - changed FMPPGET to FMPPPUT in FMPPPUT source list
fire/sn/obj/makefile - organized compile list
                       Note that the source routines in fire/sn use fire/sn/common/FMPARM
                       as a dependency, but the other objects use fire/base/FMPARM.
                       The two FMPARM files are identical.
fire/wc/obj/makefile - added SSTGMC to FMCFMD dependency list
                     - deleted duplicate dependencies in FMSOUT compile instructions

Impact on users: No impact, output did not change.
