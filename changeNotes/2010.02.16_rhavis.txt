Files:
./bm/src/dgf.f       - added mapping for added PAs
./bm/src/ecocls.f    - added new PAs and additional species, SDImax and SI values
./bm/src/habtyp.f    - added new PAs
./base/src/initre.f  - added logic to SITECODE keyword to echo statement when
                       dunning codes are used in CS, NC, SO and WS variants.
./base/src/revise.f
./dfb/src/dfbwin.f   - Changed MYACT parameter to MYACT(1) in call to OPREDT.
./fire/base/src/fmusrfm.f - This fixes two things.  First, if the FUELMODL keyword
                            was being used to set things back to the default fuel
                            model logic, this keyword was listed as NOT DONE in
                            the activity summary, when in fact it had been done.
                            This was corrected.  Second, the FUELMODL keyword wasn't
                            working properly when used in conjunction with the 
                            FIRECALC keyword - it was getting deleted or cancelled
                            when it shouldn't have been. This was corrected.
