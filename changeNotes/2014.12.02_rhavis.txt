A new keyword, the Point Group keyword, defines a group of points that
can be referenced by a single name or group number, and will be treated
as a group in management actions or event monitor functions. Users may
define up to 30 point groups with each group containing up to 50 points.
If the group name is entered in the point field of a keyword, the keyword
action will apply to all points in the group.
