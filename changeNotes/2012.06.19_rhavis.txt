Subject: Metric Version of Northeast Variant, and bug fix
Name: R. Havis
Date: June 19, 2012
Variants affected: ALL

Description: A metric version of the northeast variant was created.
             Species codes output to a database were being set to the 
             2-character alpha code format whenever a 2-character alpha
             code was used in a keyword. This has been corrected.

Impact on users: Users should obtain new executables.

New Directories:

./metric/ne/src
./metric/ne/obj

Files:

./base/src/spdecd.f - Removed "IF(ISP.GT.0)JSPIN(ISP)=1" at line 115 because
                      it reset species reporting format to 2-character alpha
                      when a keyword using 2-character species code was processed.
./bin/makefile - added build instructions for the metric version of the northeast
                 variant, FVSnem.exe, updated FVScrmc build instructions
./common/includeSVN.f
./metric/base/src/sumout.f - changed third variable in output record (X3) to integer
                             for the condition LPRT=.TRUE.
./metric/cr/obj/makefile - added separate compile for climate extension, added
                           FVSSTDCM.F77and METRIC.F77 include files to fvsstd.f
                           dependency list
