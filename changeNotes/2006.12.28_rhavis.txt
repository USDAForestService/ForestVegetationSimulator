Subject: R8 and R8 Default Merch. Specs. CCFCAL routines and other updates
Name: R. Havis
Date: December 28, 2006
Variants affected: BM, CA, CR, CS, LS, NC, NE, PN, SO, TT, UT, and WC

Description:
1) The default Merch. Specs. were updated for R9. The BFVOLUME and VOLUME keyword
processing was updated so scheduling changes in Merch. Specs. properly tracks
defaults in R9. Keyword echos reflect that top diameters can not be changed in
R8 and R9. R8 now operates like R9 in that defaults are always used.

2) Equation documentation was added to the CCFCAL routine comment areas, and
various corrections to logic and coefficients were applied as described below.

Impact on users:

The keyword guide should be changed to show the default Merch. Specs. for R9,
and remove the statements "Changing it will cause reported board/cubic foot
volumes to be zero" in the BFVOLUME and VOLUME keyword descriptions for SE/SN F4.
Could substitute the statement "Changing it will cause no change in reported
board/cubic foot volumes".
