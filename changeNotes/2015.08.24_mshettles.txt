Date: August 24, 2015
Variants affected: All except KT	

Description: 

	1. For all variants except KT: Following extensive literature review,
   	sprouting estimates were improved upon for all species except quaking aspen

	2. SN variant: Sprouting estimates for scarlet, cherrybark, blackjack, 
	northern red and post oak for location codes 809**, 810**, 905** and 908**
	were changed to use the equations from the CS variant.

	3. CS variant: Shortleaf pine (< 7" dbh) was added to the sprouting 
        species list.

	4. CI and EC variants: Listed sprouting species that weren't sprouting, 
	now sprout. These include quaking aspen (26) in EC and pacific yew (12) in CI.	 

Impact on users: users should obtain new executables.
