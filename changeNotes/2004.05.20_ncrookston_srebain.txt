Subject: Enhancements to Potential Fire Report, fixed initial snags in SVS
         images, modified FFE Event Monitor variables.
Name: Nick Crookston and Stephanie Rebain
Date: May 20, 2004
Variants affected: All.

===================== Description: =====================
1. Enhancements to Potential Fire Report included adding surface fire flame
lengths, P-Torch, and Conditional Surface Fire as a fire type. The
format of the table was changed to accommodate the new output variables.
The modifications included writing "S" for "SURFACE", "P" for "PASSIVE",
"A" for "ACTIVE", and "C" for "COND_SUR" (conditional surface fire).
Updates were made to the data base extension to output these variables. A
few column names were modified to make them more consistent.

2. The data base extension documentation was updated to reflect the change
in the Potential Fire Report.

3. Modified the SVS code to correctly represent the number of snags
recorded at inventory time (there were 2X the number of snags being drawn
than there should have been).

4. Modified the calling sequence so that snag salvage is done prior to
aging snags.

5. Added surface flame lengths as options in the POTFLEN function.

6. Modified FFE so that four FFE Event Monitor variables and two functions
do not have values during the first and second calls to the EM, but get
their values once they are correctly computed. They are available for
COMPUTE expressions that are evaluated after the second call to EM. This is
accomplished by adding a call to EVTSTV from the FFE that allows pending
COMPUTE expressions to be computed during the cycle.

7. Fixed some bugs in the trial harvest logic.

8. Made some very minor changes as listed below under "house keeping".

=====================
Impact on users:
=====================

1. Users of the data base extension will need to rename existing
FVS_PotFire tables to a new name because the new table column names are
different than the old ones.

2. SVS images will be correct when snags are in the inventory.

3. The change to the FFE Salvage option is minor and was done in
preparation of other changes in the Salvage and SVS logic.

4. The change to the FFE-Event Monitor logic was made so that computed
variables have values that match the values reported in the FFE output
tables for the year the values are computed. This changes affects computed
variables that are functions of FFE variables, FFE functions, or both. The
four affected variables are: CRBASEHT, CROWNIDX, TORCHIDX, and CRBULKDN.
The two affected functions are: FUELLOAD, and POTFLEN. Variables and
functions that are not affected are: FIRE, FIREYEAR, MINSOIL, and SNAGS.

Logical expressions that contain affected FFE variables and FFE functions
will never be true because these variables and functions will never have
values during the first and second calls to the Event Monitor. Logical
expressions that are functions of computed variables will be based on the
values last known for those variables. When those variables have values
that are functions of affected FFE variables and FFE functions, the values
will be from the most recent cycle, not the current cycle.

5. Trial harvest logic change only effects some experimental uses.

Files:
=====================
base/src/svestb.f -- fixed the number of snags per acre.
fire/base/src/fmmain.f --
           moved call to salvage to occur prior to call to fmsnag. added
           call to evtstv to request pending computation of user-defined
           variables (some of which are functions of FFE variables that
           are now defined at this point in the code).

fire/ppe/src/fmpphv.f -- moved call to salvage to occur prior to call to
                        fmsnag (see fmmain.f)

fire/base/src/fmpofl.f --
           added calculation of P-Torch, surface fire flame length, and
           conditional surface fire type. changed the format of the report
           and modified the calls to the database extension. cleaned up
           comment formatting.
base/src/rann.f --   added entry points to get and put the random seed.
base/src/exdbs.f --  modified to match new arguments
dbs/src/dbsfmpf.f -- added new variables to table, enhanced column names.
fire/base/src/fmssum.f --  added a comment
base/src/svsnage.f -- removed some stale code, reformatted source code.

fire/base/src/fmsdit.f -- initialized IFMYR1 to -1 so we can use it as a
           flag to show when FFE has not yet started. Added calls to unset
           FFE Event Monitor variables.
fire/base/src/fmevmon.f --
           added return codes so we can track when variables are defined,
           also added surface fire lengths to POTFLEN function.
base/src/exfire    -- added return codes to correspond to new arguments in fmevmon
base/src/evldx     -- added use of return codes used to load on FFE event mon functions.
base/src/evtstv    -- modified to let first argument be a year and to post
                      the OPDONE for computed variables equal to that year.
dbs/src/dbsexecsql -- enhanced the error reporting
dbs/dbsDocument/DB-FVS-UserGuide.doc -- updated to show new variables in FFE tables


======= The following changes are additional to what is listed above. They are fixes
related to the PPE trial harvest logic.

base/src/grincr.f -- simplified the code that controls when SSTAGE and SDICAL are
                    called when the PPE is linked.
base/src/opeval.f -- added code to suppress evaluation of expressions during cycle zero.
base/src/opfind.f -- use the return code from opeval, it was being ignored.
ppbase/src/hvaloc.f -- added calls to sstage, sdical, and sdicls to insure related E.M.
                      variables are available during trial harvest logic.
ppbase/src/hvhrv1.f -- same change as in hvaloc.

======= Other house keeping fixes
base/src/svstart.f -- modified to remove RANCOM and took advantage of new entry points
                     in rann.f
base/src/initre.f -- fixed IRECNT for the READCOR keywords.
