Description: Edited the Plant Association codes in the CA varaint so they no longer require
             the pre-prended "X". 

Impact on users: No longer will require an "X" in the front of the PA code if it comes in 
                 with out a PA reference code.

Files:

./ca/habtyp.f - removed the prepended "X" on all the Plant Association codes.
./ca/ecocls.f - removed the prepended "X" on all the Plant Association codes.
./ca/pvref6.f - removed the prepended "X" in the PA crosswalk
