Subject: New SimFire Option
Name: Stephanie Rebain
Date: February 24, 2005
Variants affected: All variants with FFE

Description: 
A new option was added to the SimFire keyword, allowing users to turn off the
predicted simulated fire mortality.  This is done thru the 5th field on the keyword.
If field 5 = 1 (the default in FVS and Suppose), FFE will predict simulated 
fire mortality as usual.  If field 5 = 0, no mortality will be included as part of
the simulated fire.  Users then have the option of including their own mortality
predictions, by species and size class, using the FixMort keyword.

Impact on users:
This should have no impact on previously created simulations.  It simply gives
users an addition option when simulating fires.

Files:
fire/base/src/fmeff.f - added a new argument, mkode, that holds whether FFE mortality is turned on or off.
fire/base/src/fmin.f - added an additional field
fire/base/src/fmburn.f - set mkode and added it to the call to fmeff
fire/base/src/fmpofl.f - added the new argument in the call to fmeff
