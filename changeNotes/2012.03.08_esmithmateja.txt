Subject: Oregon White Oak sprout height

Variants affected: PN WC

Description: Edited the PN and WC code so that the initial heights of white oak were reduced.

Impact on users: White oak uses a modified site index based on max height for the species.
                 The sprouting height estimates are obtained by dividing by the base age
                 for the site index equation. This was changed from 50 to 300, to provide
                 more appropriate height estimates for Oregon white oak sprouts.
