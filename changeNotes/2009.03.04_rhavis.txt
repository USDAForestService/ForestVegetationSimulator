Variants affected: ALL - Salvage Bug
                   CI, TT, UT -  PV Code / PV Ref. Code cross walks

Description:

1) The FVS Update Bulletin No. 672 describes the use of FSveg Potential
   Vegetation Codes and Reference Codes in FVS. The list of valid PV Code,
   PV Reference Code sets has been updated for all of Region 4 (CI, TT, and
   UT variants). For details, please contact the Forest Management Service
   Center.

2) There was a problem when the salvage keyword was applied to a stand
   consisting of all dead trees. The salvage action was not applied.
   This has been corrected.
