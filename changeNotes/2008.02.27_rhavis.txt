Subject: BLM volume in PN variant
Name: R. Havis
Date: February 27, 2008
Variants affected: PN, WC

Description:
The PN variant was using the VARVOL routine from the WC variant.
The BLM forest codes and volume equations were not mapping to
the appropriate volume equation processing routines.
This was corrected. In WC, NATCRS was accessing the incorrect variant.

Impact on users: BLM users of the PN variant should obtain new executables
