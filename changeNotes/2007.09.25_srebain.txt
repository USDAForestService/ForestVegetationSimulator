Subject:  Fire and Fuels Extension - Carbon Reporting Updates
Name: Stephanie Rebain	
Date: 09/25/2007
Variants affected:
all variants with FFE (all variants except CS and AK)

Description:
1) A new FFE carbon event monitor function was created.

CarbStat(arg1) returns carbon stored in various pools, in whatever units are designated with the CarbCalc keyword.
The following pools correspond exactly to those reported in the two existing FFE carbon reports.

arg1 = 1 returns the total aboveground live tree carbon
arg1 = 2 returns the merchantable aboveground live tree carbon
arg1 = 3 returns the belowground live carbon (roots)
arg1 = 4 returns the belowground dead carbon (roots of dead or cut trees)
arg1 = 5 returns the standing dead carbon
arg1 = 6 returns the down dead wood carbon
arg1 = 7 returns the forest floor carbon
arg1 = 8 returns the shrub and herb carbon
arg1 = 9 returns the total stand carbon
arg1 = 10 returns the total removed carbon
arg1 = 11 returns the carbon released from fire
arg1 = 12 returns the merchantable removed carbon in wood products
arg1 = 13 returns the merchantable removed carbon in landfills 
arg1 = 14 returns the merchantable removed carbon emitted with energy capture
arg1 = 15 returns the merchantable removed carbon emitted without energy capture
arg1 = 16 returns the merchantable removed stored carbon (products + landfills)
arg1 = 17 returns the merchantable removed carbon (all categories)

2) An additional option was added to the CarbCalc keyword so that users can output the 
two carbon reports in metric tons/acre.

CARBCALC  - Set carbon accounting parameters
Fields 1, 3-5:    same as earlier versions 
Field 2:          units for output
                  0 or blank = use imperial units (tons carbon per acre)
                  1 = use metric units (metric tons carbon per hectare)
                  2 = use combined units (metric tons carbon per acre)
                  Default is 0.

3) A bug was fixed in the removed carbon value, as reported in the stand carbon report.

Impact on users:
This change does not affect numerical output.  However, the headers for the two carbon
reports were modified.  These changes will be included in Suppose in its next update.

Files:
fire/base/common/fmfcom.f77 - added new array carbval
base/src/algkey.f - added the new em function carbstat
base/src/evldx.f -  added code for the new function
base/src/algevl.f - added code for the new function
fire/base/src/fminit.f - initialized carbval to 0
fire/base/src/fmdout.f - removed return statments so that calculations would always be made,
                         in case carbstat em function is being used.
fire/base/src/fmevmon.f - added a new entry point (fmevcarb) for the new em function.
fire/base/src/fmin.f - added new reporting units option to the CarbCalc keyword
fire/base/src/fmcrbout.f - added processing of new reporting units option; set carbval
fire/base/src/fmchrvout.f - added processing of new reporting units option; set carbval
fire/ppe/src/fmppget.f - added the new common variable
fire/ppe/src/fmppput.f - added the new common variable
base/src/exfire.f - added a new entry point for fmevcarb
fire/base/src/fmscut.f - initialized LVCRWN to 0 
                         (this was causing problems in runs with more than one stand)
