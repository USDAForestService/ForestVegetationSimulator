Variants affected: CR, UT, TT, EM, CI, IE, BM, EC, SO, CA, WS, PN, WC

Description:

1)  Corrections were made to the crown biomass estimates for pinyon and juniper species.
    Very minor changes were made to the crown biomass estimates for bristlecone pine and gambel oak.

Impact on users:
Users of these variants should download new executables.  

Modified Files:
fire/ws/src/fmcrow.f - corrected a comment
fire/base/src/fmcroww.f - corrected the crown biomass equations for pinyon and juniper so that the 
                          proper diameter value (in cm) was being used.  Adjusted the small tree crown
                          estimates for pinyon, juniper, bristlecone pine, and gambel oak to scale based on
                          diameter rather than height so that the equations work well across different 
                          variants (which may have different height-diameter relationships).
