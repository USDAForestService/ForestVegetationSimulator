Subject: Compression of variable Height to Top Diameter

Variants affected: All

Description: The tree bole height from stump to the specified cubic foot
             or board foot top diameter is written to the
             tree list, cut list, and after treatment tree list
             database tables. When compression of the tree list
             occurs during a simulation, the values for these
             heights were not accurate. The values for these
             heights were not accurate for trees created in the
             tripling algorithm. This has been corrected.

Impact on users: Users should obtain new executables.
