Subject: New FVS Event Monitor Function - StrStat

Description:
A new event monitor function, STRSTAT, was created that allows users to compute custom 
variables and conditionally schedule activities based on all of the variables in the
structure statistics output table (see the STRCLASS keyword).

STRSTAT(I,J), where:

I = 1 = nominal dbh for stratum 1
I = 2 = nominal height for stratum 1
I = 3 = height of the tallest tree in stratum 1
I = 4 = height of the shortest tree in stratum 1      
I = 5 = height to crown base for stratum 1
I = 6 = canopy cover for stratum 1
I = 7 = major species 1 for stratum 1
I = 8 = major species 2 for stratum 1
I = 9 = stratum status code for stratum 1
I = 10 = trees per acre for stratum 1
I = 11 = nominal dbh for stratum 2
I = 12 = nominal height for stratum 2
I = 13 = height of the tallest tree in stratum 2
I = 14 = height of the shortest tree in stratum 2         
I = 15 = height to crown base for stratum 2
I = 16 = canopy cover for stratum 2
I = 17 = major species 1 for stratum 2
I = 18 = major species 2 for stratum 2
I = 19 = stratum status code for stratum 2
I = 20 = trees per acre for stratum 2
I = 21 = nominal dbh for stratum 3
I = 22 = nominal height for stratum 3
I = 23 = height of the tallest tree in stratum 3
I = 24 = height of the shortest tree in stratum 3             
I = 25 = height to crown base for stratum 3
I = 26 = canopy cover for stratum 3
I = 27 = major species 1 for stratum 3
I = 28 = major species 2 for stratum 3
I = 29 = stratum status code for stratum 3
I = 30 = trees per acre for stratum 3
I = 31 = number of strata
I = 32 = canopy cover
I = 33 = structure class

and J = 0 is before thinning and J = 1 is after thinning

Impact on users:
None, this simply gives users an additional feature.  To use the STRSTAT event monitor
function, the structural statistics calculations must be toggled on with the STRCLASS
keyword (similar to the structural statistics event monitor variables).
