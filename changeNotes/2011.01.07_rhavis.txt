Subject: Misc. bugs fixes in establishment extension and database extension
Name: R. Havis
Date: January 07, 2011
Variants affected: ALL

Description:

1) As a general rule in FVS, a year or a cycle may be used interchangeably in
   field 1 of keywords to schedule activities. When a cycle number was used
   in field one of the ESTAB keyword to indicate the date of disturbance
   it was not processed properly. This has been corrected.

2) When the estab routine was entered and no trees were added to the tree
   list, the tree list was always sorted anyway. A sort of the tree list
   changes the projection slightly because the randomization of the growth
   calculations are applied to the tree list in a different order. This 
   could happen if the ESTAB and the TALLEY keywords were used without 
   specifying any other action. Logic was added to skip the tree
   list sort if there were no trees added to the tree list in a call to
   the ESTAB routine. 

3) The input database file name, including path, specified in the DSNIN 
   keyword record was limited to 80 characters. This limit has been
   expanded to 240 characters.
   
4) The FVS database extension has been updated to recognise FIA species
   codes when a leading zero has been removed (e.g. FVS will recognise
   either 019 or 19 as a valid species code for subalpine fir).


Impact on users: The simulation cycle may be used in field 1 of the
                 ESTAB keyword. The specified database name plus path
                 may now be up to 240 characters in length. Tree data
                 may now containg two-digit FIA species codes without
                 a leading zero.

Files:
ESNUTR - added code to convert cycle index to year when needed.
ESTAB - added logic to skip call to ESGENT if no trees were
        added to the tree list.
