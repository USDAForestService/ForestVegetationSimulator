Subject: Volume Update
Name: R. Havis
Date: April 3, 2014
Variants affected: Central Rockies

Description:

CR variant: The default volume equation for ponderosa pine has been changed to
            a Fleweling equation, 300FW2W122, for the Apache Sitgreaves, Coconino,
            Kaibab and Tonto forests in Region 3. The addition of the
            300FW2W122 equation number as a default makes it available
            for use with any species in R3 through the VOLEQNUM keyword.

Impact on users: Volumes for the Apache Sitgreaves, Coconino,
                 Kaibab and Tonto forests will be affected if stands
                 contain ponderosa pine.
