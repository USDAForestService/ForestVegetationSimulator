Description:

CR variant: The default volume equation for ponderosa pine has been
            changed to 300FW2W122 for the Apache Sitgreaves, Coconino,
            Kaibab and Tonto forests in Region 3. The addition of the
            300FW2W122 equation number as a default makes it available
            for use with any species in R3 through the VOLEQNUM keyword.

Impact on users: Volumes for the Apache Sitgreaves, Coconino,
                 Kaibab and Tonto forests will be affected if stands
                 contain ponderosa pine.
