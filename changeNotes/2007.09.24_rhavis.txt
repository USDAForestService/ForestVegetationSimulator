Subject: Mapping Formclass by Forest
Name: R. Havis
Date: September 24, 2007
Variants affected: EC

Description: Formclass is needed for the Behre volume equations. The arrays
             of formclass values by species were not being correctly mapped
             to the different National forests. This has been corrected.

Impact on users: Users should obtain new executables. This update will
                 slightly affect volume calculations.
