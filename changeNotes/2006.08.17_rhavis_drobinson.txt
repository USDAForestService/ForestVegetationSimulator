Subject: FFE-Carbon Tracking Update
Name: D. Robinson (ESSA), R. Havis
Date: August 17, 2006
Variants affected: FFE only - bm, ca, ci, cr, ec, em, ie, ls, nc, ne, ni,
                              pn, sn, so, so33, ut, wc, ws

Description: Updates to Carbon Tracking FFE Code
A new FFE variant-specific routine (FMCBLK.F) contains a BLOCK DATA statement
and requires compile instructions, and addition to link lists.
The data from FMCBLK.F is carried in common within a new INCLUDE file (FMPROP.F77)

Impact on users: None - This code is in development and has not been
                        implemented for users.

Files:

fvs/fire/base, ca, cr, ie, ls, ne, pn, sn, so33, ut, and wc/MAKEFILE
added new include file fire/base/common/FMPROP.F77 to dependencies for the following
routines FMBIO, FMCHRVOUT, and FMSCIT 

fvs/fire/bm, ca, ci, cr, ec, em, ie, ls, nc, ne, ni, pn, sn, so, so33,
         ut, wc, ws/MAKEFILE
added compile instructions for variant specific routine FMCBLK.F

bin/MAKEFILE
added FMCBLK to FFE link lists

base/src/natcrz.f. and econ/src/ecin.f - corrected placement of commas
Thanks to Don Robinson for these corrections.

This package provides updates to the C reporting module currently
under development. It should not have any effect upon current 
FVS or FFE output. The next update of this code set will be
the preliminary release version.
