Subject: New option processor routine plus ppe changes 
Name: Nick Crookston
Date: 2004.02.24
Variants affected: All

Description:
The new routine allows for reading "activities" from an external file
and loading them into the simulation dynamically. This feature will be
used in landscape simulations that us an external program to simulate
fire behavior. It will also be used to enable the ability to use an
external program to simulate regeneration establishment.

In addition to adding the new routine, changes in the PPE were made
to support external calculation of fire dynamics.

Impact on users:
None for now.

Files:
./ppbase/src/ppmain.f -- added call to oprdat to read activities from
                         file JOEXOPT (must already be connected).
./common/PPCNTL.F77 -- added JOEXOPT
./ppbase/src/hvsel.f -- modified to support external calculation of
                        fire dynamics
./ppbase/src/hvin.f -- automatically turn off "Exact" when external
                       selection logic #1 is being used.
./ppbase/src/ppinit.f -- initialize JOEXOPT
./base/src/oprdat.f -- new routine
