Subject: ECON harvest volume and values
Name: F. Martin
Date: September 2, 2010
Variants affected: All Western Variants

Description: A potential error in ECON harvest volume and values was corrected:
when merchantability specifications differed for cubic versus board-foot volumes,
ECON may have failed to recognize these differences.

Impact on users: Econ Users should obtain new executables

Files:
common/ECNCON.F77 - added logDibBf and LogDibFt3, removed LogDib
econ/eccalc.f     - deleted blank lines
