Subject: Improve reporting of computed variables
Name: Stephanie Rebain and Nick Crookston
Date: 2005.05.05
Variants affected: All

Description: Sometimes the order that computed variables were output did
not match the order they were being computed. This caused the last reported
value of a specific variable to not be its true final value. So, we fixed it.

Impact on users: In some cases, the compute variable values in the activity
summary will be different than before; now the last value computed will always
be listed last. This will also be true in the FVS_Compute table generated using
the database extension to FVS.

In addition, all activities will be listed in order they are actually done
by FVS and not necessarily in the order scheduled.

A side effect of the change is that variables that are never computed and
any activity that is reported "NOT DONE" or "DELETED OR CANCELED" will
always be listed first.

 force proper sequence reporting.

base/src/opexpn.f -- set ISEQDN to appropriate starting value
base/src/evtstv.f -- modified debug and insured IPHASE is 2 when user
 defined variables are being computed in a specified year as done by
 the fire extension.
base/src/opinit.f -- set initial value of ISEQDN
common/OPCOM.F77 -- added variable ISEQDN
ppbase/src/putstd.f -- stored ISEQDN
ppbase/src/getstd.f -- get ISEQDN

dbs/src/dbscmpu.f -- when the first variable was in state "NOT DONE",
 none of the variable would be added to the database.  We fixed that
 problem and some other related issues.
