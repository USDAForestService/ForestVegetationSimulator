Subject: Carbon Accounting Update 
Name: R. Havis, D. Robinson
Date: September 29, 2006
Variants affected: FFE Only

Description:  Was removing all crowns left in the stand, including those on downed snags.
 Modified so that it only subtracts those crowns that are on the removed trees.
 Also put a check at the end of the code to ensure that the removed amount cannot be 0.

Impact on users: Code not released yet

Files:
./em/src/regent.f - corrected indexing of max height check - no effect unless tree was > 999 ft.
./fire/base/src/fmscut.f. - added logic for above
