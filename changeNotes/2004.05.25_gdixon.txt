Subject: Mortality, SDI maximums, BA maximums
Name: Gary Dixon
Date: 5/25/04
Variants affected: CS, LS, NE, SE variants especially; All variants to some extent

Description: 
This change has 3 components:
1) Users of the CS, LS, and NE variants had limited options to control the mortality model. SDIMAX and BAMAX had no effect on projections. These changes implement both of those options. Also, the TWIGS-based mortality rates were not responsive enough to changing stand conditions and ofter over-predicted mortality. These changes correct those problems
2) In the other SE variant, the mortality model was changed to be more responsive to changes in stand conditions and to correct problems with the TWIGS-based mortality rates.
3) The setting of SDI maximums from BA maximums OR the setting of BA maximums from SDI maximums was changed in all variants. BA maximums will be the BA maximum limit observed in the summary output table, and these BA maximums correspond to 85% of the SDI maximum.

Impact on users: All users should obtain a new executable.
