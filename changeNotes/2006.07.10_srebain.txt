Subject: Fire and Fuels Extension Code Change - Fuel Model and Fuel Load Initalization
Name:  Stephanie Rebain
Date:  07/10/2006

Description:
1 - Users can now initialize the fire behavior fuel model for a stand thru the
StandInit table of an input FVS database.  Previously, this could only be
done thru a keyword (FuelModl).  The new column name that FVS will recognize
is FUEL_MODEL.  Entry is the fire behavior fuel model number (0-13 for the
original set, 101-204 for the Scott and Burgan fuel models).  Custom fuel models
can also be entered, as long as they have been defined (see the DeFulMod keyword).

2 - The FFE keyword FuelInit has been expanded.  Originally, there were fields for
the following dead surface fuel categories:
0-1", 1-3", 3-6", 6-12", 12"+, litter, and duff

The 0-1" fuel entered by a user was split half and half into the internal
0-.25" and .25-1" pools.

With this change, the keyword was expanded to include two subcategories - 
0-.25" and .25-1" fuel.  Now if these extra fields are included in a run, they will
override the 0-1" value.  If these extra fields are not included, the results
will be the same as before with half of the 0-1" fuel in the 0-.25" class and half
in the .25-1" class.  Accordingly, two new columns can be read from the StandInit
table of an input FVS database (FUEL_0_25 and FUEL_25_1).

Revised FuelInit keyword:
Field 1: Initial fuel load for the 0-1" class (tons/acre)
Field 2: Initial fuel load for the 1-3" class (tons/acre)
Field 3: Initial fuel load for the 3-6" class (tons/acre)
Field 4: Initial fuel load for the 6-12" class (tons/acre)
Field 5: Initial fuel load for the 12"+ class (tons/acre)
Field 6: Initial fuel load for litter(tons/acre)
Field 7: Initial fuel load for duff (tons/acre)
Field 8: Initial fuel load for the 0-0.25" class (tons/acre)
Field 9: Initial fuel load for the 0.25-1" class (tons/acre)

Impact on users:
This has no effect on output.  It simply gives users additional features.
The updated FuelInit keyword will be available in the next version of 
Suppose.  The FFE addendum and Database Extension documentation will be
updated shortly.
