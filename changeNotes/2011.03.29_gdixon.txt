Variants affected: Western Sierras (WS)

Description: 
1) At the request of R5 this variant has been expanded from 11 species
   to 43 species. New species are modeled using existing growth
   equations from other species in the WS and other variants. The 
   complete species list and surrogate equations used are as follows:

Impact on users: 
   Users of the WS variant should obtain a new executable. Projections for the
   original WS species (SP, DF, WF, GS, IC, BO, JP, RF, PP, TO, and GC)
   will remain unchanged. Projections for the other softwoods (OS) and other hardwoods (OH)
   species groups may be different because some of the trees that used to be assigned to 
   these groups are now projected as seperate species. Since the original WS species have been 
   assigned a different FVS sequence number in the expanded variant, any runstream using FVS 
   sequence numbers to designate species on keywords, or any runstreams containing keywords with
   species ordered parameters cannot be directly used with the new expanded variant.
