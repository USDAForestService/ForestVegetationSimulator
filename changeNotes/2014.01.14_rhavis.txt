Subject: Misc, Updates and Corrections
Name: R. Havis
Date: January 22, 2014
Variants affected: ALL

Description: 

1) PN and WC (BLM forests): A coefficient in the volume equation for
   hemlock (B00BEHW260) in was corrected in the BLM Behre's function.
   Refer to Volume Library Bulletin No. VO161_010613.txt
   
2) All variants: There was a problem in writing large lists of variables
   to the FVS_Compute Table. The maximum size for the list of variables
   was increased to correct this issue.
   
3) CS and LS variants: The incorrect species list was being used in small tree height
               calculations. Therefore, while small trees were getting height
               increments added each cycle, the increments may not have been
               representative of the correct species.


Impact on users: BLM users should obtain new executables. Users of the
                 FVS_Compute database table should obtain new executables.
                 CS, and LS users should obtain new executables
