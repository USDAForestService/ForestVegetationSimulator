Subject: Changes needed to make stop/restart work and to remove
the need to have a specific search sequence in the directories 
that contain files that are included in compile statements. Some 
minor issues are also covered. Note that this changeNotes document
does not list all the changes recently made as some were committed 
prior to this set. Please consult the change logs in the open-fvs
repository. 

Name: Nick Crookston
Date: Aug 23, 2012

Variants affected: All (modified code is in open-fvs).

Description: 

First, note that changes noted below were made to the metric variants 
and to ni as well as those 20 currently being built in open-fvs. 
Furthermore, note that this changeNotes document does not list all 
the changes recently made as some were committed a few weeks ago. 
Please consult the change logs in the open-fvs repository for r333 
through r347.

1) MXFRCDS was added to PRGPRM and used to set the size of some
arrays in ESCOMN. All copies of PRGPRM are affected (and note that
PRGPRM is always variant specific, never in the common directory).

2) ESCOMN was removed from cr as it's text is now the same for 
all variants. A modified version is in the common directory.

3) Initialization of ZRAND was removed from all copies of regent 
as the approach being used did not work if the treelist gets shorter 
and then longer during a single simulation. Code to correctly set 
the value of ZRAND(I) was added to all copies of esuckr, estab 
(estb and strp), intree, comprs, and apisubs.

4) sn: Unused variables in SNCOMN were removed and the two that remain
were added to varput/varget for the sn variant (they are new for the
variant). ISEFOR = 0 was added to sn/src/grinit.f as it could otherwise 
be left undefined do to obtuse code in sn/src/forkod.f. 

5) Code that deals with the MODTYPE for the now retired se variant was
removed from initre. 

6) bin/FVScrc_sourceList.txt and bin/FVSsn_sourceList.txtfiles were 
updated to reflect these changes.

7) In the tests directory in open-fvs, several of the save files were
updated do to the change in ZRAND which caused answers to change.

8) In some routines, minor changes were made to get consistent output
when debug is turned on.

Impact on users:
Minor changes in results in some simulations.
