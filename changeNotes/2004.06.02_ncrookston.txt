Subject: Modifications to support external BM establishment model.
Name: Nick Crookston
Date: 2004.06.02
Variants affected: ALL

Description: Modified Estab and Strip versions of the Establishment Model
to support the use of an external program for simulation establishment. The
changes are to modify the processing of the ADDTREES keyword (and add it to
estb/src/esin.f) and to build in support to esaddt.f.  The source for this
routine is currently identical for both full and partial estab.

Impact on users: NONE until this work becomes production (it has not yet
been announced).

Files:

base/src/oplist.f -- fixed an entry in the keyword mapping tables.
base/src/oprdat.f -- changed the argument list, adding a return code.
estb/src/esaddt.f -- added code to run the external establishment routine.
strp/src/esaddt.f -- same as estb
estb/src/esin.f   -- modified processing of ADDTREES keyword
strp/src/esin.f   -- same as estb
ppbase/src/ppmain.f -- added extra return to call to oprdat.f
