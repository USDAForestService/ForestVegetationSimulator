Subject: Calibration of the height-diameter function

Name: Gary Dixon
Date: 04/07/11

Variants affected: 1) CA, SO, SN, TT, UT

Description:  Tree records eligible for calibrating the height-diameter curve for a species
must have measured heights at the time of inventory and exceed a species specific
diameter threshold for the variant. This diameter threshold has been changed:
	a) from 5.0" to 3.0" for all species in the CA and SN variants.
	b) from 3.0" to 5.0" for NF, WH, PY, WA, RA, BM, CW, CH, WI, GC, MC, MB, OH in the SO variant.
	c) from 3.0" to 5.0" for BI and MC in the TT and UT variants.

Impact on users:  Users of the CA, SO, SN, TT, UT variants should obtain a new executable.
