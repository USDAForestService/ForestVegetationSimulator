Subject: NE variant OIN OAK alpha and FIA codes
Name: R. Havis, G. Dixon
Date: September 27, 2006
Variants affected: NE

Description: In the NE variant species Seq. No. 63 was identified as northern pin oak Alpha
             code = NP, FIA code 809. This was incorrect and has been changed. Species No. 63
             (Quercus palustris) is more appropriately identified as pin oak, Alpha code= PN,
             FIA code= 830.

Impact on users: Users should be aware that the identificatoin of Species No. 63 in the Northeast
                 variant has been changed, but there will be no effect on simulations. The NP
                 alpha code and 809 FIA codes will be mapped appropriately.
