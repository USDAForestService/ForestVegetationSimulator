Description:

1) OC and OP variants: When detecting a grand fir or Douglas fir in the
                       input tree data, these variants use height and
                       crown dubbing from the ORGANON extension. When
                       this occurred there could be errors in the missing
                       input height data report in the main output file.
                       This has been corrected.

2) Region 9 variants: Trees having heights less than 17.3 feet were assigned
                      zero volume. This has been changed so that volumes are
                      calculated for trees having heights less than 17.3 feet.

3) SN variant: The SN variant may be used for projections on the Mark Twain
               (forest 905) and the Shawnee (908). The units of the reported
               board foot (BF) volumes was Scribner BF. The BF volume units
               has been changed to International 1/4 BF for these forests.
               Because of code reorganization, rounding of volume output was
               introduced which may cause some volume output to slightly differ
               from previous software versions.

Impact on users: On Region 9 forests trees having heights less than 17.3 feet
                 will show volume in FVS output. Board foot volumes on the Mark
                 Twain and Shawnee will appear higher because the volumes are in
                 International 1/4 board foot units.
