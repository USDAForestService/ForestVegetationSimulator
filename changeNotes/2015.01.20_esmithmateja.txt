Description:  An error was found in ni/cwcalc.f code, it was incorrectly 
              setting the National Forest 'BF' coefficient (used in Equation #5,
              Crookston (2005)). This error has been resolved. 

Impact on users:  It may slightly modify the crown width calculation for any
                  species using Equation #5 in ni/cwcalc that has a BF value
                  other than 1.0.
