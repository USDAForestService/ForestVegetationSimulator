Subject: Upgraded ECON extension, and correction to DBS input variable processing
Name: Fred Martin (WADNR), Robert Havis
Date: August 9, 2006
Variants affected: ALL

Description:
1) STK_PCT, FINTH, and FINT variables input through data base tables were not fully
   or correctly processed. See description of changes to the DBSSTANDIN routine below.

2) A completely upgraded set of ECON extension code was provided by Fred Martin
   for integration into the production code and further testing. The makefiles 
   were upgraded to build FVSniec, FVSieec and FVSieecfm.

Impact on users: All DBS users should obtain new executables

Files:
dbsstandin.f - The real variables FINT and FINTH were created from their
               integer counterparts (IFINT and IFINTH).
               The STK_PCNT variable is equivalent to the GROSPC variable
               on the DESIGN keyword. STK_PCNT was not processed correctly,
               and could cause a numerical error when STK_PCNT=0.
               This has been changed so
                1. < STK_PCNT <=100, GROSPC=0.01*STK_PCNT
                0. < STK_PCNT <=1. , GROSPC=STK_PCNT
                     STK_PCNT=0.   , GROSPC is calculated based on number
                                            of stockable plots
