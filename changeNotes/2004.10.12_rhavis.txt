Subject: Set initital crown width for seedling and sprouts, correct 
source code semantics
Name:  R. N. Havis
Date: 10/12/04
Variants affected: Variants attached to the cover extension and also 
                   having sprouting species - IE, NC, TT and WS

Description:  Crown width was assigned to new sprouts (ESUCKR) and to
              seedlings established in the ESTAB routine.  Refinements
              to other routines solve problems discussed below.

Impact on users: There was a potential for numerical errors in the 
                 cover extension when a zero crown width of sprouts
                 or seedlings was used in covr/CVSU to calculate
                 canopy cover.
