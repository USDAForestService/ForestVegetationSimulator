Subject: SPECPREF and Database Extension
Name: Nick Crookston
Date: 2004.09.17
Variants affected: All

Description:

Changed the processing of SPECPREF so that it works the way all thinning
keywords work. Prior to the change, SPECPREF keywords coded with a zero in
field one were immediately processed even if they were inside an IF-THEN
clause. This caused SPECPREF keywords that were meant to be processed
conditionally to be processed regardless of the condition. Those coded
using the PARMS feature are not affected by this change.

The Data Base Extension change will provide for linking to the FSVeg
database.

Impact on users:

The SPECPREF change could impact existing users as the order of processing
the SPECPREF commands will change. The species composition of the residual
stands, and therefore subsequent projection may change.

The Database Extension change should not affect existing users.

Files:
base/s
rc/initre.f -- Changed the processing of SPECPREF
base/src/intree.f -- Minor change to the debug output recently sent out.

dbs/src/DBSCOM.F77 -- Added a vector necessary for tree-level query
processing (this fixes a potential bug).

dbs/src/dbsstandin.f -- Several changes to enhance data type matching, added
code to write information to the output that displays the values read
from the database, added several data items including initial fuels data.
Provided for NRCS species codes for site species. Build "location code"
from region, forest, and etc, using variant-specific rules. Reformatted and
reorganized the source code.

dbs/src/dbstreesin.f -- Enhanced data type matching, provided for 8-char
species codes. Reformatted and reorganized the source code.
