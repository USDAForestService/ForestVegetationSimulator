Subject: BF Volume Methods in CS, LS, and NE Variants
Name: R. Havis
Date: May 15, 2014

Variants affected: CS, LS, and NE

Description:

LS variant: All of the National Forests in Region 9 (CS, LS and NE variants)
            were using the Gross Scribner Board Foot volume calculation
            method. This was changed so that the Chequamegon, Chippewa,
            Nicolet, Ottawa, Superior, Hiawatha, and Chequamegon-Nicolet
            National Forests in the LS variant use the Gross Scribner 
            Board Foot volume method and all other National Forests in
            Region 9 use the International 1/4 inch rule.

Impact on users: Region 9 users should get new executables.
