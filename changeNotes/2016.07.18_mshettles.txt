Subject: Diameter growth bounding in PN, WC and OP. 
Name: Mike Shettles
Date: 7/18/2016
Variants affected: OP, PN and WC

Description: If there were discrepancies between the observed growth period and the defualt 
cycle length, erroneous diameter growth bounding was occuring. This has been reconciled.

Impact on users: Diameter growth prediction may change.
