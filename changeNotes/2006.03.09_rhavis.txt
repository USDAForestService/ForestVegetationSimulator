Subject: Rev Back R5 Crown Width Equations
Name: Robert Havis
Date: March 9, 2006
Variants affected: CA, NC, So and WS

Description: Crown width is used in the Cover and Fire and Fuels
             Extension (FFE) calculations. In November of 2005, 
             new crown width equations were introduced for all
             western variants (see FVS Update Bulletin No. 616).
             At the request of Region 5, these new crown width
             equations for R5 have been removed, and replaced
             with the old (pre FVS Update Bulletin No. 616)
             equations.

Impact on users: Users should obtain new executables. 

Files:
ni/cwcalc.f - added call to R5CRWD routine for R5 Forests
moved so33/src/R5CRWD to ws/src - so33/R5CRWD is now obsolete
ws/R5CRWD - changed SO mapping
Seq. No. 12 changed CW Eq. from 4 to 12
Seq. No. 14 changed CW Eq. from 5 to  4
Seq. No. 17 changed CW Eq. from 27 to 6

so33/obj/makefile - compile ws/R5CRWD rather than so33/R5CRWD
bin/makefile
added the ws/R5CRWD object reference to the following executables
