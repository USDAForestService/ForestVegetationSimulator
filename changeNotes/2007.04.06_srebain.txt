Variants affected:
all variants with FFE (all variants except CS and AK)

Description:
The returned values of the new FFE event monitor function PotFType were altered.  

PotFType(arg1) returns potential fire type.
arg1 = 1 returns potential severe fire type
arg1 = 2 returns potential moderate fire type

To better match FARSITE and FlamMap, the returned values are now as follows:
1 = surface fire
2 = passive crown fire
3 = active crown fire
4 = conditional surface fire

Impact on users:
This affects anyone using the PotFType function.
