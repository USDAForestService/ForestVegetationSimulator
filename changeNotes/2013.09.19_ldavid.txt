Description: When using the RAWS daily weather data option, the user may
             specify a range of years contained in the RAWS data file that
             will be used for the projection. The range is specified on 
             record following the RAWS weather data file name with beginning
             4-digit year and ending 4-digit year separated by a space. When
             all yeard in the RAWS data set is to be used, enter "0 0" for
             the range. To determine what years with complete data are present
             in the RAWS daily weather data file, the user needs to first
             perform a simulation without a range of years specified and then
             view the Special Events Table, where the weather data year is
             reported in association with events indicating favorable and
             unfavorable conditions that may sustain or suppress prolonged
             defoliation events.
             

Impact on users: General Defoliation Model keyword WEATHER has changed, users
                 will need to edit their keyword file(s) to include additional
                 supplemental record for weather year range.
