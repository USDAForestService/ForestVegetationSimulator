Subject: Miscellaneous changes in the FVS-ORGANON variants
Name: Gary Dixon
Date: mm/dd/2017
Variants affected: OC and OP

Description: Continued enhancement of the OC and OP variants, so they produce answers consistent with the
stand-alone ORGANON growth and yield model, and accomodate user needs. Included in this group of changes:

1) Developer and funding credits in the ORGANON settings table have been made model-type specific to match 
   those displayed in ORGANON output.

2) Updated the Swiss Needle Cast growth modifier equations to 4/8/15 versions.

3) Corrected an error in the ORGANON height growth subroutine so western hemlock uses the white fir equation 
   in the SWO model type.

4) Corrected the setting of the ORGANON user prescription thinning code.

5) Corrected a problem with crown ratios not being dubbed correctly, and calibration values not being 
   computed correctly. Now, for valid ORGANON stands, dubbed crown ratios and calibration values are
   exactly the same as those produced by ORGANON.

Impact on users: Users of these two variants should obtain a new executable. 

Files:

/organon/src/growth_mods.f Updated the Swiss Needle Cast growth modifier equations to 4/8/15 versions.
                           
/organon/src/htgrowth.f    Corrected line 666 so western hemlock uses the white fir equation in the SWO model type.

/organon/src/orgtab.f      Credits for model developers and funding sources were made to be specific to model-type.

/oc/src/cratet.f           Corrected setting of the Organon user prescription thinning code. Corrected the tree-level
                           expansion factor for Organon model calibration.

/op/src/cratet.f           Corrected setting of the Organon user prescription thinning code. Corrected the tree-level
                           expansion factor for Organon model calibration.
