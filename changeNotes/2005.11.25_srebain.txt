Subject: Fire and Fuels Extension Update
Name:  Stephanie Rebain
Date:  11/25/2005
Variants affected: ALL FFE variants

Description:
1) NPV (native plant community) codes are used in the LS-FFE to determine the fuel model.  
A correction was made to the way these codes are read in.  

2) Corrections were made to the calculations of consumed and killed crown material when fires are simulated.


Impact on users:
Users of LS-FFE may see changes in output in cases where the NPV code was
previously not being read in correctly.
Users should expect small to moderate changes in FFE output when simulating fires.

Files:
ls/src/habtyp.f - corrected NPV character codes for proper read in.
fire/base/src/fmeff.f - made numerous corrections to the calculations that consume and kill 
                        crown material when fires are simulated, especially in cases where the user
                        shuts off the FFE-predicted mortality or when only a portion of the stand
                        is burned.
