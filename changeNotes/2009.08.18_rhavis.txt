Subject: CRUZFILE keyword
Name: R. Havis
Date: August 18, 2009
Variants affected: ALL

Description: The CRUZFILE keyword was enhanced to carry through user input
             volume equation numbers from the VOLEQNUM keyword to the
             output file (.ncp file) that is used as input to the National Cruise
             Program. A new column for volume equation numbers was added to the .ncp file
             so that cubic foot and board foot equations numbers are written. A new column
             for forest district was added to allow processing R8 volumes in the
             National Cruise Program.
             
Impact on users: Users of the CRUZFILE keyword should obtain new executables. R8 users
                 may use CRUZFILE keyword and obtain volumes for the first time.

Files:

VARVOL - added argument to entry GETEQN so that 2 equation numbers CF and BF) are
         passed to the NATCRZ routine. Except for R8 and R9 these Eq. Nos. are loaded
         from the volume CF and BF Vol.Eq. No. arrays. Added logic to
         accomplish this, and deleted unnecessary logic. Removed reference
         to the VOLEQ and EQN variables where needed. Added variables EQNB and EQNC. 

./ak/src/varvol.f
./an/src/varvol.f
./base/src/algcmp.f  - added check on IOPS variable value upon exiting routine to
                       avoid potential array-out-of-bounds error upon reentry to routine.
./base/src/natcrz.f  - added subroutine argument, and modified write statement and format
                       statements to accommodate added Vol.Eq. No. and calculate and write 
                       district number in .ncp file. Corrected logic to calcualte SN
                       variant forest number. Added logic to write FIA species code for
                       R8. 
./base/src/svout.f   - Changed selection of SVS tree definition file from variant specific
                       file to eastern/western US specific file. Eastern variants (CS,LS,NE,SN)
                       now use the east.trf file while all others use west.trf.
