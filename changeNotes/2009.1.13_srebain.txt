Subject: Fire and Fuels Extension Update
Name:  Stephanie Rebain
Date:  01/13/2009
Variants affected: all FFE variants

Description:
Two new FFE keywords were developed to allow users to adjust the fire behavior calculations.
The details behind the new options can be found in the latest version of the FFE addendum.

     1) FIRECALC
     
     Modify the fire behavior calculations.  Users can choose to use the original
     fuel model selection logic, the new fuel model selection logic (includes
     the 40 new fuel models) or can choose to predict fire behavior from
     modelled fuel loads directly.  The SAV and bulk density values entered are
     used only if the new fuel model selection logic or the modelled loads option
     is chosen.  The heat content entered is used only if the modelled loads
     option is chosen.  These variables should be entered as they pertain to your
     fuel bed and will be used to help select the most similar fuel model(s) (if using
     the new fuel model logic) or will be used directly in the fire behavior
     calculations (if using the modelled loads option).

     field 1: Year or cycle in which the fire behavior calculations will be changed.  Default = 1.  
              (Once in effect, this keyword stays in effect until replaced with another FireCalc keyword.)
     field 2: The fire behavior calculations should use:
              0 = the original FFE fuel model selection logic (Default)
              1 = the new fuel model selection logic (includes the 40 new fuel models)
              2 = modelled loads directly in predicting fire behavior
     field 3: Fuel model set for use with the new fuel model logic:
              0 = use the original 13 fuel models 
              1 = use the 40 new Scott and Burgan fuel models
              2 = use all 53 fuel models (Default)
     field 4: Surface area to volume ratio (1/ft) for 1 hr (0-.25") fuels.  Default = 2000.
     field 5: Surface area to volume ratio (1/ft) for live herb fuels.  Default = 1800.
     field 6: Surface area to volume ratio (1/ft) for live woody fuels.  Default = 1500.
     field 7: Bulk density (lbs/ft3) for live fuels.  Default = 0.10 
     field 8: Bulk density (lbs/ft3) for dead fuels.  Default = 0.75
     field 9: Heat content (BTU/lb).  Default = 8000                                         


     2) FMODLIST
     
     Adjust the fuel models available for selection in conjuction with the new
     fuel model logic (also see FireCalc keyword).  Fuel models can either be turned 
     "on" (they will be part of the potential fuel model pick list) or turned
     "off".  See the FFE documentation for details on the new fuel model logic and
     what fuel models are part of the pick list by default.  Once set, this keyword
     stays in effect unless reset.

     field 1: Year or cycle in which the keyword will apply.  Default = 1.  
              (Once in effect, this keyword stays in effect unless reset.
               Multiple FMODLIST keywords can be used simultaneously.)
     field 2: Fuel model (1 - 204).  Default = 1
     field 3: Fuel model status:
              -1 = use default logic to determine if fuel model is part of the pick list (Default)
              0 = fuel model IS part of the pick list  
              1 = fuel model IS NOT part of the pick list  

Impact on users:
Simulation runs will not change by default.  These new options are now available and documented
in the FFE addendum.
