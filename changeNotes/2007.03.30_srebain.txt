Subject:  New FFE Event Monitor Functions - POTSRATE, POTREINT
Name: Stephanie Rebain	
Date: 03/30/2007
Variants affected:
all variants with FFE (all variants except CS and AK)

Description:
Two new FFE event monitor functions were created.  

PotSRate(arg1) returns potential fire spread rate in feet/min.
arg1 = 1 returns the potential severe fire spread rate assuming a surface fire
arg1 = 2 returns the potential moderate fire spread rate assuming a surface fire
arg1 = 3 returns the final potential severe fire spread rate (taking any crown fire activity into account)
arg1 = 4 returns the final potential moderate fire spread rate (taking any crown fire activity into account)

PotReInt(arg1) returns potential fire reaction intensity in BTU/ft2/min.
arg1 = 1 returns potential severe fire reaction intensity
arg1 = 2 returns potential moderate fire reaction intensity

Impact on users:
This change does not affect output.  These functions simply give users more options.
These functions will be included for selection in Suppose in its next update.
