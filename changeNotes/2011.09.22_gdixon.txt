Variants affected: CI (Central Idaho)

Description: At the request of R4 this variant has been expanded from 
             10 individual species and 1 "other" species group for all 
additional species, to 17 individual species and 2 species groups for other
softwoods and other hardwoods. Species now contained in this variant are:

New species are modeled using existing growth equations from other species in the
CI and other variants.
   
Impact on users: Users of this variant should obtain a new executable. Projections for the
   original individual CI species (WP, WL, DF, GF, WH, RC, LP, ES, AF, and PP)
   will also change due to a correction in the CI mortality model.
