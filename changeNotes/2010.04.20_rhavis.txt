Files:
base/DBSSTANDIN - The value of FKOD hasn't been assigned causing runtime error using some data bases.
                  Set FKOD=-1 at line 971 to avoid error. May be OK if the photocode is present.

base/CUTS - corrected logic for thinning to a BA target with the THINPT / SETPTHIN keyword combination

ca/PVREF6 - deleted water association in crosswalk

ca,ie,strp,wc/ECUSKR - added logic to control sprout numbers as described in 1) above.
