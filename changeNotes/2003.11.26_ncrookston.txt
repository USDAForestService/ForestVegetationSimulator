Subject: Bug fix for one-tree case and structure class fix.

Description:
A bug was fixed in spesrt for the case where only 1 tree record exists on input.
A bug was fixed in sstage. The post thinning structure stage event monitor 
variables were being incorrectly reported to the event monitor in the case 
where thinnings did not actually happen. 

Impact on users:
1. Runs with 1 tree record that failed will no longer fail.

2. After-thin event monitor structure variables will be correct. This will only
affect users that use any of the following event monitor variables: ASCLASS, 
ASTRDBH, ACANCOV, AMAXHS, AMINHS, or ANUMSS.


Files:
base/src/spesrt.f -- modified as needed to set variables correctly in special case.
base/src/sstage.f -- added code to set the correct values in the event monitor.
base/src/evtstv.f -- added a new entry point to query event monitor variables.
