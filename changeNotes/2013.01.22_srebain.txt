Description:

1) The fuel loading values associated with each fire behavior fuel model were adjusted to be more precise.
 
Impact on users:
It is not imperative that users obtain new executables. This code change is minor and non-urgent.

Modified Files:

fire/base/src/fminit.f - edited the values of the FMLOAD array, which holds the fuel loading (lbs/ft2) by size class for
                         each of the fire behavior fuel models.  Specifically the values were expanded to go 5 places after
                         the decimal rather than 3.  This was updated so that FVS output would more closely match the output
                         of other fire models, which may store the fuel loading in tons/acre.
