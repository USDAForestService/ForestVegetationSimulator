Description: Tree History data is read from the input tree files and
             written into the Tree Value column of the Tree List tables.
             The data for recent dead and longer term dead trees was
             not being written correctly to the data base Tree List
             table. This has been corrected. The ECON - Harvest Data
             Base table was not being written consistently. This
             was corrected by Aaron Crossland, Washington DNR. 

Impact on users: Users may obtain new executables at their own discretion.
