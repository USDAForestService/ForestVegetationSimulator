Variants affected: CI

Description:

 Moves of ../ci/src files to ../ci and ../fire/ci/src to ../fire/ci resulted
 in the loss of file log histories for these two sets of files. All attempts 
 to restore them resulted in a commit error "Unexpected HTTP status 502 
 'Bad Gateway' on" files and folders. The log histories of these files can
 seen by using repository browser and setting revision at 2366 or checking
 out a version of trunk at revision 2366. If a method to restore thsi history
 to revision HEAD is found it will be done.
 
 SouceList files were updated for new folder structures of CI variant specific
 files.

Impact on users: Builds for CI variant executables and dlls were browken for
                 last couple of days but are corrected now.
                 code may have a faulty version of sdical.f that will
                 not calculate Curtis relative density.
