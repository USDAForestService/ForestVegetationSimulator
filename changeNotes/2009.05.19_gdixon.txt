Subject: climate change code corrections

Variants affected: all variants

Description: As climate changes, FVS needs the capability to go from a forest condition
             to a non-forest condition, or visa-versa.  This is currently being done
             through manipulation of the SDI maximums. These changes allow users, or the
             climate extension to adjust SDI maximums from forest values to zero, or 
             something near zero (non-forest condition) to positive values (forest 
             condition.  

Impact on users: No effect on current simulations. However, these changes will allow anyone
             using the SETSITE keyword to simulate climate change to adjust species
             sdi maximums down to 1, indicating a land condition that would not support trees.
