Subject: Database Extension Cutlist Table and other changes
Name: Stephanie Rebain

Variants affected: All

Description: An error with the way cutlists were output using the database extension was corrected.
In previous versions of the code, only one cutlist could be output per run.  As a result, if thinnings
were scheduled multiple times throughout a run, only the cutlist from the first thinning was output 
to the database.  This has been corrected so that multiple cutlists can be output per run.

Also, some column headings within the FVS_Fuels and FVS_Consumption tables were modified.

Impact on users: 
All database extension users should obtain new executables.

Users of the data base extension will need to rename existing
FVS_Fuels and FVS_Consumption tables to a new name because the new table
column names are different than the old ones.  (Users will not be able to
append data to these tables using new versions of the code, if they were originally
created with older versions of the code.)

Files:
dbs/src/dbscuts.f - commented out some code that prevented multiple cut lists
                    from being output in a simulation.  
dbs/src/dbsfuels.f - changed some of the database column headings in the FVS_Fuels table.
dbs/src/dbsfmfuel.f - changed some of the database column headings in the FVS_Consumption table.
dbs/dbsDocument/DBSUserGuide.doc - updated the column headings for the FVS_Fuels 
                                   and FVS_Consumption tables.
base/src/grincr.f - in the last update to grincr.f, I moved calls to sdical and sdicls, 
                    but did not remove the original calls.  In this change, I removed 
                    the redundant calls.  This should have no impact on simulations.
