Subject: Update R1 Potential Vegetation Codes.
         Reassign values to duplicated location codes

Variants affected: EM, IE, KT

Description: Potential vegetation (PV) codes for R1 variants have been added to
             each respective pvref1.f subroutine. PV codes are based off of 
             FSVeg supplied PV codes that were used in R1. All new PV codes 
             were cross-walked to exisitng PV codes in the variant guides.

Impact on users: More reliable potential vegetation code cross-walks and 
             mapping.

Variants affected: AK, NC, SO

Description: There were duplicate location codes across five total variants. 
             Duplicates have been changed to new/unique location codes in
             three of the variants. Changes are: 
             - SO: original 701 (industry) changed to 702
             - AK: original 701 (BC/Makah) changed to 703
             - NC: original 800 (Simpson) changed to 715
             All changes are in the respective forkod.f subroutine. 

Impact on users: Users will see dual forest codes in the three variants. 
             The new codes have only been mapped to existing codes so the 
             original codes will still work. For example, in the SO
             variant, Industry is now 702 that is mapped to 701. Both 701
             and 702 still work in the SO variant.  

Files:

em,ie,kt/
   habtyp.f - Added ADJUSTL to place leading zero on 2 digit numbers.
   pvref1.f - Updated data statements to accomodate/cross-walk new 
             potential vegetation codes.

ak,nc,so/
   forkod.f - Added new location codes and mapped to existing code.
