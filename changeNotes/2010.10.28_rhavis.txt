Subject:Metric DBS, and Misc. Updates
Name: R. Havis
Date: October 28, 2010
Variants affected: CA, CR, NC, SO, WS

Description:

1) When dunning code was used in R5 variants and site species is blank
   in StandInit Table, the Data Base extension attempted to write the site species
   which was undefiled at that time. This caused the .out file to be converted
   to Hex format. The solution was to set species affected by site index to "ALL"
   for writing to the .out file. 

2) The Data Base extension was updated to write CR to CASES table rather than the
   Central Rockies sub-model type symbols.
   
3) The metric version of the Central Rockies variant was updated to read the stand
   and tree list using the Data Base extension. Thanks to Don Robinson, ESSA, for
   this code.
   
Impact on users: Users of the Central Rockies and Region 5 variants may obtain
                 a new executable at their own discretion.

Files:
./bin/makefile       - added metric DBS compile command, and the DBS metric link
                       list to the FVScrm executable build instructions
./bin/FCWindows_NT.make - added dbs link list for FVScrm, and compile command for
                          metric dbs routines
./dbs/obj/makefile   - added include file dependencies to the dbsmis.f compile
                       instructions
./dbs/src/dbscase.f  - added logic to convert Central Rockies sub-model codes to the
                       CR designation
./dbs/src/dbsstandin.f - set CSITECODE variable when dunning codes are input without
                         assigning site species
./metric/dbs/obj/cr/makefile - new directory and makefile containing CR metric DBS routine
                               compile instructions
./metric/dbs/src/dbsmis.f   - removed tabs
./metric/dbs/src/dbsstandin.f - declared variable (J)
./mistoe/src/DMCOM.F77 - new routine included in dbsmis.f
