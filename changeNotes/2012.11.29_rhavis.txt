Subject: Miscellaneous Bugs
Name: R. Havis
Date: November 29, 2012
Variants affected: EC, Metric Variants

Description:

1) The build instructions for the East Cascades variant (EC) climate extension
   was incorrect in the Fort Collins makefiles. The Blue Mountains variant common 
   directory was being used as a source for the include files for building the EC
   variant climate extension. This has been corrected.

2) Metric versions of the Central Rockies and Northeast FVS variants are available
   upon request from the FMSC. When using database input format in the metric
   variants, the Elevation field (stand elevation in 100s of feet) and the 9th
   argument of the SPMCDBH Event Monitor function (Merch. Volume) were not being
   converted to metric units. This has been corrected thanks to Don Robinson, ESSA.
  
Impact on users: Users of the East Cascades climate extension and metric variants
                 should obtain new executables.

Files:

./clim/ec/obj/makefile - changed common directory to fvs/ec/common
./common/includeSVN.f
./metric/base/src/evldx.f - metrified field 9 of the SPMCDBH EM function
                            added ACORN EM variable, still needs metrification
./metric/dbs/src/dbsstandin.f - metrified Elevation variable
