Name: R. Havis
Date: June 9, 2010
Variants affected: EM, IE, KT, NI, and CS, LS, NE and SN

Description:
1) Some PV Code/reference code combinations were not being mapped to the
   appropriate FVS habitat type code. This has been corrected.
   
2) In Region 8 and Region 9 the Tree List table was not being printed correctly
   when the stand inventory consisted of all dead trees. This has been corrected.

Impact on users: Users of the effected variants should obtain new executables.
