Description:
Correction to SDIMAX cross-reference table -- There were two problems with the writing of the SDIMAX cross
reference table in the output file: (1) if you used a SPCODES keyword to change the input species code for
one or more species, the new species codes were showing up in this table; and (2) in some variants there 
were extra lines being written with only the line labels. I changed the write statement to reference array
NSP instead of array JSP. I changed the logic to prevent the extra set of label lines. I also standardized
the write statement across all variants.

Miscellaneous debug write changes -- in ie/src/dgf.f I fixed the 9000 format statement so the leading
character of the array label would print; in cr/src/badist.f I added the 165 Format statement to control
printing of debug output; in base/src/sdical.f I added the 17 Format and 18 Format statements to control 
printing of debug output.

Upgrade of default volume equation routine -- in modifying volume/src/voleqdef.f for the upgrade of the EM
variant to 19 species, I noticed this routine contained a lot of tab characters. Also, the indentation of
statements was not consistent which made the routine hard to work with. I added the extra species to the
R1 section of the routine, deleted the tab statements, and aligned the indentation so it made sense.
