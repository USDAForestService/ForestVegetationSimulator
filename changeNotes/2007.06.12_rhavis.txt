Subject: Tree Biomass Event Monitor Variable TreeBM
Name: R. Havis
Date: June 12, 2007
Variants affected: ALL-FFE

Description: The TREE BIOmass event monitor variable provides estimates of
             the biomass of standing trees (live and/or dead) and the biomass
             of trees removed from the stand through harvest and/or salvage. 
             The parameters for the TREEBIO Event Monitor function are
             described below
