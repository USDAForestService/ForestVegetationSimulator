Subject: Modification to Climate-FVS
Name: Nick Crookston
Date: May 18 2012
Variants affected: All western variants

Description: Added new mortality logic and overhauled the output table.  Also
added code to push the new database tables into the database. A new keyword 
parameter was added to the mortmult keyword. This is all covered in a revision
of the document called: Climate-FVS Version 2: Keyword Guide and Notes for Users. 

Impact on users: Outputs will be different. This change includes support
for new variables in the input as well.
