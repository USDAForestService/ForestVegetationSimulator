Subject: FVS version number

Description: The FMSC Subversion (SVN) repository version number will now be
             used as the FVS version in the main FVS output file header. This
             version number is read from the SVN file management files and
             stored in a new file that is not under version control
             (fvs/common/includeSVN.f). Developers not using a similar
             SVN system as the FMSC may edit the file to reflect their
             own versioning system, or retain the FMSC version of the
             code update. If using the FMSC make utility, and not a
             similar SVN version control system, developers should
             remove the instructions from the base/obj/MAKEFILE that
             build fvs/common/includeSVN.f, but retain the includeSVN.f
             file in the fvs/common directory.

Impact on users: None

Files:
fvs/common/includeSVN.f - this file is built in base/obj/MAKEFILE and is
                          not under version control.
obj/MAKEFILEs - the includeSVN.f file was added as a dependency to the GROHED
               routine compile instructions

GROHEDs - The fvs/common/includeSVN.f file was added in an INCLUDE statement
          to the GROHED routines. Logic was added to write the SVN repository
          version number to the FVS main output file header.

./base/obj/makefile - added instructions to build the common/includeSVN.f file using commands developed
                      by Nick. This file contains the SVN repository version number which is read from
                      the .svn/ENTRIES file. The number read from .svn/ENTRIES reflects the repository
                      version the last time the working copy was updated from the repository.
./bin/makefile - added macro (allFVS) to build all base and climate FVS executables.
