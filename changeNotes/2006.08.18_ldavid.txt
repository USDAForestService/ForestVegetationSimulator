Variants affected: FFE only - bm, ci, cr, ec, em, ie, kt, nc, ni,
                              pn, so, so33, tt, ut, wc, ws

Description:

A new base common file METRIC.F77 (initiated by Don) has been
implemented and a few metric conversion factor variable names 
needed changed in the RD model to facilitate the removal of the 
METRIC.F77 common file that existed (but is now deleted) in rd/src.

Makefiles were also modified to redirect the path for METRIC.F77
from fvs/rd/src to fvs/common.

Two obsolete directories under rd/obj (cr, pn_wc) were also removed.

rdin subroutines had additional cleanup and some keyword processing
error messages had been inadvertently suppressed with the keyword
echo control, LKECHO.

Impact on users:

None.
