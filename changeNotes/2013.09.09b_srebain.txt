Description:

1)  Simulation errors were occuring when the FixMort keyword was being used with the mortality proportion set to a value greater than 1.
    This was corrected - mortality proportions are now checked and limited to be between 0 and 1.  

Impact on users:
Users of the Fixmort keyword may want to download new executables.
