Subject: Fire and Fuels Extension - Southeast Alaska Variant and other FFE changes
Name:  Stephanie Rebain
Date:  03/31/2008
Variants affected: Southeast Alaska (AK), PN, WC

Description:
1)The Fire and Fuels Extension was calibrated for the Southeast Alaska variant of FVS.
Model relationships were mainly based on those used in the Pacific Northwest variant.

2)Bark thickness values were corrected for two species in the PN and WC variants.

Impact on users:
This is a new feature for AK FVS users.
FFE will be available for selection with the AK variant in the next version
of Suppose.
These changes are documented in the FFE addendum document.
Users of PN-FFE and WC-FFE should obtain new executables.

Modified Files:
bin/makefile - changes made to compile AK-FFE (added ffe to FVSak; 
               deleted exfire in AK_Link, added fire_ak_compile and FIRE_AK_OBJ)
bin/FCWindows_NT.make - added dbsfmcrpt.obj and dbsfmhrpt.obj to the AK link
                        list
fire/pn/src/fmbrkt.f - fixed the bark thickness values for pacific silver fir and western hemlock
fire/wc/src/fmbrkt.f - fixed the bark thickness values for pacific silver fir and western hemlock
fire/base/src/fmr6sdcy.f - added code so that the AK-FFE could use the PN rates
fire/base/src/fmr6fall.f - added code so that the AK-FFE could use the PN rates
fire/base/common/fmparm.f77 - increased TFMAX to 60 since the TFALL values for AK are as high as 55.

New Files:
fire/ak/src/fmsnag.f - has the AK-FFE snag relationships
fire/ak/src/fmvinit.f - initializes many variables within AK-FFE
fire/ak/src/fmcfmd.f - the AK-FFE fuel model selection logic
fire/ak/src/fmcba.f - estimates initial dead fuel loadings and herb and shrub
                       loadings
fire/ak/src/fmcrow.f - calculates the crown biomass for individual trees
fire/ak/src/fmbrkt.f - has the bark thickness values for AK-FFE
fire/ak/src/fmcblk.f - has the variant-specific carbon parameters
fire/ak/obj/makefile - changes made to compile AK-FFE
