Subject: FFE Restructuring update
Name:  Stephanie Rebain

Variants affected: All

Description:

1)  FFE was restructured to run on cycles, rather than annually.  This results in significantly faster model speeds 
and reporting years matching the base FVS model.  Also, the order of the FFE model has been changed to be more consistent.
All of the activities (salvages, simulated fires, pileburns, and others) are modelled first.  Second, all of the reports
are printed.  Third, all of the various pools are updated with regard to snag fall, snag height loss, snag decay, down wood
decay and down wood accumulation.  As a result of this change, all reports and event monitor variables and functions now print
post-activity values.  Also, the values reported for the initial year represent the inventory conditions and do not
incorporate a year of change (such as decay and accumulation when looking at the down wood values).

Impact on users:
Users should download new executables if desired.  Output values will be different due to this change.  Note, the interpretation
of some output (whether it is a pre-activity or post-activity value) has changed.  The last argument of the SNAGS function,
which let users select from pre or post-salvage values, has been eliminated.  Because of small differences in modelled fuel loads,
users may expect small differences in potential and simulated fire behavior.  Other differences in snag estimates, fuel consumption
estimates and other values may occur due to the change in timing as to when calculations are done relative to when reports are printed.
