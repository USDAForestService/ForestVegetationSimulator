Subject:Restructuring crown width estimation

Description:
     Crown width was being calculated when it was needed for various reasons
at 19 different places in the model. In many cases, crown width was predicted from
CCF equations. New and improved crown width equations are being published. Also, 
users want the ability to enter crown width multipliers to change the estimates. All
these factors necessitated restructuring the way crown width is calculated and 
handled within the model.
     Summary of changes: (1) crown width will be carried in as a variable (CRWDTH(i))
in Common. It gets initialized at cycle 0 and updated at the end of each cycle from
MAIN. Users will have two new keywords to manipulate crown width calculations: the
CWEQN keyword allows users to enter their own species specific crown width 
equations; the FIXCW keyword allows users to manipulate crown widths by species
and size class.
     These changes set the stage for actual revision of the crown width estimation 
equations. Those will be upgraded in a future change. The call to CCFCAL will be 
removed from CWIDTH at that time and replaced with a call to a subroutine containing
either eastwide or westwide crown width equations.

Impact on users: Users should not see any difference in runs with these changes.
However, users will now have the ability to enter their own crown width equations 
or manipulate the crown width estimates using keywords.

Files:
COMMON
   ARRAYS.F77 added the array CRWDTH() to carry estimated tree crown width
