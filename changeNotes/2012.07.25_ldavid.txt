Subject: General Defoliation model daily weather data processing update

Name: Lance R. David
Date: July 25, 2012

Variants affected: BM, CI EC, EM, NI, SO, TT

Description: Daily weather data processing of up to 50 years was added to the General 
             Defoliation model. At this time, this option is pretty bare in its 
             implementation and is not released to the general users. The current 
             implementation does not include options to control weather data years or
             lapse rate to adjust for elevation differences and reporting improvements
             are needed for these options as well.

Impact on users: None at this time, not released to general users.

./wsbwe/src
   bwecm2.F77   added BWPRMS array and variable IYRCNT for daily weather processing,
                added declaration of variable ADMORT
   bwecup.f     added check for presence of host species
   bwein.f      modified WEATHER keyword option processing for RAWS Daily data processing,
                modified processing that takes place after END keyword is encountered to
                call BWERAWS subroutine.
   bweint.f     added initialization of BWPRMS array
   bwelit.f     added code to handle loader of weather parameters from BWPRMS arrays,
                added code to detect loss of all host species so model doesn't crash 
                on budworm dispersal and there is no host trees to recieve them.
   bwep4.f      added report output for RAWS Daily Weather processing
   bwepdm.f     added requirement that missing foliage categories for top and middle crown
                thirds must be greater than zero before topkill and mortality is calculated.
   bweppgt.f    added control parameters and reading of BWPRMS array
   bwepppt.f    added control parameters and writing of BWPRMS array
   bweraws.f    new routine for processing daily weather data and loading the bwprms array

./wsbwe/obj/makefile added bweraws.f, bweppatv.f, bweppgt.f and bwepppt.f to the compile list

./bin/makefile  modified link instructions to includes bweraws subroutine for
                FVSbmx.exe, FVScix.exe, FVSecx.exe, FVSemx.exe, FVSnix.exe, 
                FVSsox.exe, FVSttx.exe

./bm/obj/makefile added bweraws.f to the compile list
