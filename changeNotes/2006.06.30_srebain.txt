Impact on users:
This has no effect on output.  I simply streamlined the makefiles to
not include unnecessary *.f77 files.

Modified Files:
dbs/src/dbsfmcanpr.f - deleted the include statements for plot.f77 and prgprm.f77, 
                       added new subroutine argument for NPLT
fire/base/src/fmpocr.f - passed in new argument to dbsfmcanpr
base/src/exdbs.f - passed in new argument to dbsfmcanpr
dbs/obj/makefile - deleted the include statements for plot.f77 and prgprm.f77 for dbsfmcanpr
