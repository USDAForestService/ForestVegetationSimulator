Subject: Fire and Fuels Extension Update
Name:  Stephanie Rebain
Date:  05/07/2012
Variants affected: All except NI and NC

Description:

1) In eastern FVS variants, the biomass estimates in the Fire and Fuels Extension were adjusted
 to improve values for trees below or near the minimum merchantable diameter for cubic foot volume.
 In the SN variant, the equations used to estimate crown biomass were switched to those in Jenkins (2003), matching
 the other eastern variants.  Because some hardwood species in western FVS variants use crown biomass 
 equations from the east, those estimates are altered as well.
 
 Jenkins, J.C., D.C. Chojnacky, L.S. Heath, and R.A. Birdsey. 2003. National-scale biomass estimators for 
 United States tree species. For Sci. 49:12-35.
  
Impact on users:
Estimates of biomass, surface fuels, canopy fuels, carbon, fire behavior and fire effects may all be different due to this
code change.  Users of most variants should obtain new executables.

Modified Files:

fire/base/src/fmcrowe.f - changed subroutine so that the crown biomass equations are those from the Jenkins' forest science pub;
                          improved how biomass is calculated for small trees for smoother behavior as tree cross the min merch dbh limit

Deleted Files:
fire/base/src/fmcrowls.f - moved these crown biomass equations into fmcrowe, rendering this subroutine useless.
