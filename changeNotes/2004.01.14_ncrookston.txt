Subject: New CanCalc keyword in FFE
Name: Stephanie Rebain and Nick Crookston

Variants affected: All (FFE only)

Description: New CanCalc keyword in FFE so as to control the way canopy base
height is computed.

The keyword CanCalc has 4 parameters:

1) method: 0 = standard method is currently the only option for this parameter. 
Currently this parameter has no effect on a run.  It was put in place because Liz 
is thinking of other methods of calculating canopy base height that we may 
implement in the near future.

2) minimum height of trees used in the calculation: by default this is 6 ft.

3) the species included: 0 = conifers only (the default), 1 = all species

4) Cutoff value used in determining canopy base height: 30 lbs/acre/foot is the default.

A slight change to the standard calculation of canopy base height was made, 
so as to match the FFE documentation.

Impact on users: Users who desire to use this option need to get program files.
Test runs show generally small changes in canopy base height and other 
related output variables.
