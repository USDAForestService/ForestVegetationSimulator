Subject: code maintenance, Black Hills PP dg bug
Name: R. Havis
Date: May 17, 2011
Variants affected: CR

Description:
1) The Forest-specific Merch. Specs. code was removed from the VOLS routines
    and added to the SITSET routines
2) A problem with the Black Hills PP diameter growth equations was causing
   unreasonable calibration values. This was corrected.

Impact on users: CR variant users should obtain new executables.

Files:
ni, ls /VOLS - removed Forest-specific Merch. Specs. code
ca, cr, cs, ls, metric/cr, metric/wc, nc, ne, pn, sn,
           so, wc / SITSET - added Forest-specific Merch. Specs. code

./bin/makefile - removed duplicated object (debug_mod.o) from FVSut link list
./ca/src/sitset.f
./common/includeSVN.f
./cr/src/cratet.f - moved call to DGDRIV, and Prep. of input height calibration
                    data, to below call to FINDAG; and branched around setting 
                    the YOUNG and OLD variables if ABIRTH() <=0
./cr/src/dgf.f - branched around setting 
                 the YOUNG and OLD variables if ABIRTH() <=0
./cr/src/gemdg.f - removed unused statement (100 CONTINUE), added trap for
                   predicted diameter when the result was less than current
                   diameter (added .1 in to current diameter)
