Variants affected: AK variant

Description: FFE linkage to new AK variant is complete. New initial fuel loading
             by forest type was derived from FIA plot data by Mark Castle. Tree
             species specific values that were in the original AK-FFE were
             retained and then other variants were used as sources. Those sources
             in order of preference were PN, LS and NE. On the issue of decay and
             litter (crown components) fall rates, new species were added to the
             classes that already existed in fmvinit.f. Bark thickness values came
             from new list of species and values provided by Duncan Lutes.            

Impact on users: FFE will function with new 23 species AK variant.
