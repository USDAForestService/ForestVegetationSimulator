Subject: CROWN WIDTH CALCULATIONS
Name: R. Havis - coding completed by Chad Keyser
Date: December 22, 2004
Variants affected: Central States (CS), Lake States (NE), Southeast (SE)
and Southern (SN)

Description: A new routine called CWCALC was introduced and is called
to return crown width.  In R8 and R9, a new routine ls/CWCALC
(replaces ls/ECRWD) returns crown width and is called by ls/CCFCAL to return
crown width for CCF calculations.  In the west ni/CWCALC calls the
variant-specific CCFCAL routines to return crown width.  The forest-specific
default values of TLAT, TLONG and ELEV are now set in the R8 and R9 FORKOD
routines specifically for the simiulation forest.  These values are
intitialized to zero in the GRINT routines.


Impact on users: The CCF values in R8 and R9 are significantly effected and
therefore growth is also effected.

LINK Notes:

bin/makefile         - add the CWCALC object to all link lists,
                            - add ni/CWCALC to the BM, CI, EC, EM, KT, NC, NI,
                              SO, TT, and WS link lists
                            - add wc/CWCALC to the PN variant link lists
                            - add the variant specific CWCALC objects to the 
                              CA, CR, IE, LS, SN, UT, and WC link lists
                     - remove ECRWD and add the variant-specific CWCALC
                       objects to the CS, LS, NE and SE variant link lists

delete ls/ECRWD
delete sn/CCFCAL
replace ls/CCFCAL with the new ls/CCFCAL routine

Compile these routines and link the CS, LS, NE, SE and SN variants 
and their extensions.
