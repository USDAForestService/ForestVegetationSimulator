Description: 1. Overflow and underflow options where added to compliler trap
                in makefile.
             2. Debug code modified in fvsvol.f subroutine.
             3. Uninitialized variables addressed in some height growth and 
                volume routines.
             4. Minor change to output database processing.
             5. Correction to array sizes in routines used in Stop/Restart
                processes.

Impact on users: Users will notice no changes, but processing speed when output
                 database is used may be improved.


Files:

bin/makefile - Overflow and underflow options where added to compliler trap.

ni/src/vols.f - BBFV varaible initialized and parameter list in calls to Econ
                Extension ECVOL corrected with removal of ISPC variable.

volume/src/fvsvol.f - Debug code modifications.

dbs/src/dbsknrows.f - Nick modified how the existance of a table in database is
                      checked. This should improve performance when output
                      database gets very large.

bm/src/htgf.f - Uninitialized variable in debug statement removed. This lead to
ca/src/htgf.f   crashes on some systems when FVS Debug was invoked for htgf 
ec/src/htgf.f   subroutine.

pg/src/getstd.f - Parameters for  integer and real arrays (MXI, MXR) updated
pg/src/putstd.f   to 120 and 131 respectively. Was missed on previous update.
