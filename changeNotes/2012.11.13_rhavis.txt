Subject: Volume Calculation Warnings and Small Tree Height Growth
Name: R. Havis
Date: November 13, 2012
Variants affected: CI, CS, LS and NE

Description: 

       1) A warning message was added to Region 9 variants to notify users when
          excessively large tree heights cause volume processing errors. When the
          processing error occurs, the warning message is written to the main output
          file, tree volume is set to zero, and processing goes on to the next tree.
          The new warning message is shown below.
          
********   FVS36 WARNING:  EXCESSIVE TREE HEIGHT: UNABLE TO CALCULATE VOLUME FOR TREE RECORD, VOLUME SET TO ZERO

       2) Negative small tree height growth calculations were possible in the CI variant, and
          could cause numerical errors in other parts of the model. This has been corrected.

       3) The REGHMULT keyword may be used to scale small tree height growth.
          If used in the CI variant, the height growth multiplier and a constant,
          were being applied twice to western white pine (WP), western larch (WL),
          Douglas fir (DF), grand fir (GF), western hemlock (WH), western red cedar (RC),
          lodgepole pine (LP), Engleman spruce (ES), subalpine fir (AF),
          ponderosa pine (PP), other softwoods (OS) and other hardwoods (OH), and the
          height growth multiplier was being applied twice to quaking aspen (AS),
          western juniper (WJ), curlleaf mountain-mahogany (MC), and black cottonwood (BC).
          This has been corrected.

Impact on users: Users of the CI, CS, LS and NE variants should obtain new executables.

                 

Files:
./base/src/errgro.f  - added FVS36 WARNING:  EXCESSIVE TREE HEIGHT: UNABLE TO
                                             CALCULATE VOLUME FOR TREE RECORD, VOLUME SET TO ZERO
./ci/src/regent.f    - moved check for negative height growth, HTGR, to check HTGR for CI variant
                       as well as the CR and TT variants, removed duplicated scaling of
                       HTGR by the XRHGRO (user provided small tree height growth multiplier,
                       REGHMULT keyword) and COM variables for the CI variant after statement 
                       No. 920, and removed duplicate scaling of HTGR by XRHGRO after
                       statement No. 9984.
./common/includeSVN.f
./ls/src/htgf.f      - changed debug write statement unit number to the main output
                       unit number variable JOSTND
./ls/src/varvol.f    - trapped volume error return code 12 from the R9CLARK routine; this
                       is triggered when the number of logs in a tree exceeds the
                       number of elements in the LOGLEN array and the tree volume is set to
                       zero, edited debug write statements
