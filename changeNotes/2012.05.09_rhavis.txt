Subject: Subroutine Arguments, and Declarations Corrections
Name: R. Havis
Date: May 9, 2012
Variants affected: IE

Description:

1) The IGL variable was added to the HTDBH call statement in 
   FMCROWE (2010.04.10_rhavis.txt). This variable has been
   removed and the PLOT.F77 routine was added, using an include
   statement in ec/HTDBH, to provide the IGL variable required
   by that routine. The HTDBH call statements in ec/CRATET,and
   ec/REGENT were also modified as described below. 
   
2) Variable declarations were corrected, and other minor code maintenance
   was performed as described below.

3) IE Variant: In the Regeneration Establishment output in the main
               output file there were blank records in Ingrowth Table. The
               blank records were between the continued Species List
               and the continued Trees/Acre list. These blank records
               have been removed.
