Description: Changes and corrections to crown dubbing for dead tree records
             Modification of the default ht-dbh relationship for PI and RM
             Correction to potentially very small, or negative, height growth 
             for PI and RM 

Impact on users: Dubbed height values for pinyon and juniper will be substantially
         different. Dubbed crown ratio values on dead trees for PI, RM, AS, MM, and
         PB will be different. Some differences in growth for pinyon and juniper will
         be seen.

Files: ie/src/
crown.f  changed the revision date; added the logical variant variable block to the 
         cycle 0 dead tree dubbing section; added the pinyon and juniper equation so
         dead tree crown ratio values are consistent with live tree values
dubscr.f changed the revision date; zeroed out coefficients for species 15, 16, 19,
         and 22 (this routine is not used for these species); modified a couple of
         comment lines accordingly
blkdat.f changed the revision date; corrected the default height-diameter coefficients 
         for pinyon and juniper to match those found in the Utah variant (these species
         were using limber pine coefficients from the Tetons variant)
regent.f changed the revision date; added a small or negative height increment check to
         the cr/ut species section (random increment is sometimes larger than the 
         calculated height growth for slow growing species like pinyon or juniper)
