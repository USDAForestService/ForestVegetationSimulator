Subject: Bug Fix and Code Maintenance
Name: R. Havis
Date: September 25, 2015
Variants affected: CR, EM, IE, LS, NE, TT, UT, TT

Description:

1) The BAU variable was not initialized in the CR variant and this
   caused a difference in output when comparing the same stand in
   single run and a serial run. TO correct this variables carried
   in GGCOM (including BAU) were initialized in GRINIT routines in
   CR, EM, IE, TT, UT, and WS. GGCOM.F77 was added to GRINIT
   where needed.

2) The TWIGCOM common carries one variable BAU. Where needed, BAU
   was initialized in ACD, and NE. TWIGCOM was not needed in several
   eastern variant routines and was therefore removed form those routines.

Impact on users: None
