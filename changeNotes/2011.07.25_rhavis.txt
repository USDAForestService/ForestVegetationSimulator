Subject: tree list cut list, after treatment tree list database table format
Name: R. Havis
Date: July 25, 2011
Variants affected: ALL

Description:

1) Data fields were added to the tree list, cut list and after treatment
   tree list output database tables such that all tables contain the
   same information. The height to Merch. top was added to the 
   tree list and cut list database tables, and the actual point number, 
   and estimated height were added to the cut list database table.

2) Logic to carry the height to Merch. top as a global variable was
   added in Region 9.

Impact on users: Users may obtain new executables at their own discretion.
