Description: Nick adapted the AIX build option in the FVS make utility to build with gfortran.
             While compiling the FVS code, using the gfortran compiler, a number 
             of code issues were identified and corrected. To use gfortran to build FVS executables,
             complete the following steps.
             
             1) Download and install the MinGW software.
             2) In a CMD window set OS to null as shown below.
             
             c:\set OS=
             
             3) In a CMD window, use the make commands to build FVS executables

Impact on users: None

Files:

The makefiles were adapted to use the former AIX option to build, instead, with gfortran.

The FPTRS6K routine has been retired. Delete it from all directories.
