         the new 19 species version of the EM variant

Variants affected: EM (Eastern Montana)

Description: An error was discovered in linking the database and economics extensions in
             the new 19 species version of the EM variant. These extensions were not being
             compiled with the expanded species specification in common PRGPRM.F77 . The 
             error has been corrected.

Impact on users: Anyone who has retrieved the 19 species version of the EM variant, which
                 was released for production use on 04/09/09 (FVS Bulletin 703), should
                 obtain a new executable.

Files:
em/obj    makefile   added compilation of the econ extension routines

bin/obj   makefile   added the EM_ECON_LINK specification and added it to the link instructions
                     for FVSem and FVSemx; changed the dbs link specification from DBS_LINK to
                     DBS_LINK_EM and the compile dependency from dbs_compile to dbs_compile_em 
                     for FVSem and FVSemx.
                     
bin       FCWindows_NT.make    added DBS_LINK_BM (will add in future for BM19) and DBS_LINK_EM

fvs/dbs/obj    created folders bm (will add in future for BM19) and em and added a makefile
               routine in each of them.
