Subject: Preparation for WS variant expansion

Name: Gary Dixon
Date: 07/27/10

Variants affected: None as far as the user is concerned.
                   For developers, AK, AN, CI, CR, EC, IE, KT, NC, NI, PN, SO, TT, UT, WC,
                   and PPBM, PPCI, PPCR, PPEC, PPKT, PPNC, PPNI, PPPN, PPUT, PPWC

Description: The WS variant is being expanded from 11 species to 43 species. The following changes 
             make the other variants independent of ws/obj object files in preparation for the
             variant expansion. It also helps to clarify where source routines come from in cases
             where either the source directory or target variant are not 11 species variants.

Impact on users: NONE

Files:
ec/src/morts            -new routine

bin/makefile            -deleted ws_compile from the dependency list for all the variants listed above
                        -added appropriate r5crwd to AK_LINK, AN_LINK, CI_LINK, CR_LINK, CR_PPBASE_LINK, 
                         EC_LINK, IE_LINK, KT_LINK, NC_LINK, NI_LINK, UT_LINK, UT_PPBASE_LINK, and WC_LINK
                        -added morts to EC_LINK
                        -deleted ws/obj/r5crwd from link instructions for FVSak, FVSan, FVSci, FVScr, FVSec,
                         FVSppec, FVSie, FVSkt, FVSnc, FVSppnc, FVSni, FVSut, FVSpput, FVSwc, and FVSppwc
                        -added appropriate r5crwd instructions to FVSppci, FVSppkt, and FVSppni
                        -deleted ws/obj/morts from link instructions for FVSec and FVSppec
                        -changed FVSpn and FVSpppn to get r5crwd from wc/obj rather than ws/obj
                        -took tt/obj/exppnb out of TT_LINK and added it as a seperate item in the link
                         instructions for FVStt to facilitate future development of FVSpptt (if needed)
                        -deleted other references to ws/obj/r5crwd in the FVSpp_ section where the link
                         instructions have not been kept up to date with the variants regular FVSpp_ 
                         instructions (e.g. FVSppbme is not up to date with FVSppbm)
                        -corrected some spacing in the COVR_LINK_x, BGC_LINK, CR_BGC_LINK, UT_BGC_LINK
                         FVSCI_, FVSEC_, FVSKT_, FVSNC_, and FVSws_ specifications 
                         (cosmetic purposes which makes instructions easier to read!)
