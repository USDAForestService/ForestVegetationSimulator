Description:

1)  evpred.f  line 65  I changed IF(LFIRE2 .EQ. .FALSE. )  to  IF(.NOT. LFIRE)       error: a logical type variable cannot be mixed with an arithmetic type variable
2)  fmevmon.f  line 923 changed IF(LSW(ISPC) .EQ. .TRUE.)  to  IF(LSW(ISPC))  error: a logical type variable cannot be mixed with an arithmetic type variable
3)  fvsstd.f    line 72 (in combination with line 52)    error: elements of a COMMON block must be initialized in a BLOCK DATA subprogram.  I moved the FVSSTDCM
common block and associated type statements to the COMMON directory FVSSTDCM.F77; added an INCLUDE FVSSTDCM statement to fvsstd; added an INCLUDE FVSSTDCM statement
and the initialization of these two variables to each of the variant BLKDAT routines; added an INCLUDE FVSSTDCM statement and associated code to subroutines PUTSTD
and GETSTD; and updated the makefile dependency lists accordingly.
4) also added common CWDCOM to the dependency list for getstd and putstd in the ppnc/obj/makefile and ppws/obj/makefile
