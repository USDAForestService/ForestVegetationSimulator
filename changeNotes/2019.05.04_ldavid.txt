Description: A new SQL SELECT statement parameter (LIMIT 1) had been added to
             improve performance by restricting number of rows returned to 1. 
             MS Access has a proprietary parameter for this purpoose (TOP 1)
             that is placed first in the statement instead of last. Having this
             query fail disabled the ability to add new columns to the FVS_Compute
             table when using MS Access database type. Code has been modified so
             that Access database types use TOP 1 parameter and other database
             types (SQLite and others) that support ALTER TABLE action to add new
             columns to an existing table uses the LIMIT 1 parameter.

Impact on users: New columns can be added to existing FVS_Compute table when
                 using database types MS Access and SQLite.

                   There is not a version of this subroutine for the Q-family
                   code in folder dbsqlite.
