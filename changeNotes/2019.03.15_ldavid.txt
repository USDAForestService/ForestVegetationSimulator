Variants affected: All variants with Western Root Disease

Description: Western Root Disease reports did not generate properly if there
             were no input tree records for the stand and trees were not
             planted in first cycle of the projection. The year lables and
             stand age in the reports were incorrect in cases where plantings
             occurred later in the projection. This has been resolved.

Impact on users: Reports in special case now correct.
