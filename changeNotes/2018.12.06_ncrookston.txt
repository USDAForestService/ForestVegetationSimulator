Subject: Log errors with very low site indicies
Name: Nick Crookston
Date: 2018.12.06
Variants affected: bm, ec

Description:
When very low site indicies are used, the log of a negetive number can
result. This change traps that condition in these variants.

A typo in dbsstandin.f is corrected.

Impact on users:
Runs with normal site index values (including leaving the value blank) are not
affected at all.
