Subject: Coefficient Corrections
Name: R. Havis
Date: November 14, 2006
Variants affected: ALL

Description:

1) A slight modification was made to the diamter assignment function for softwoods having
   heights less than 4.5 ft. (CS, LS, NE). The assignment of diameter growth values was
   corrected for softwoods having heights less than 4.5 ft. ft. the LS variant.
2) A coeffient value was corrected in the small tree height growth function for western larch (BM).
3) A coefficient value was corrected in the crown width equation for quaking aspen. This correction
   affectes trees larger than 1.0 in DBH (CA, CR, IE, PN, SO, TT, UT and WC). Minimum diameter used
   in the adjustment ratio for red alder crown width calculations (DBH less than 5 in) was changed
   from 1 in to 5 in (AK, CA, PN, SO and WC).
4) An update to the DBS extension can avoid a potential error (all variants)
