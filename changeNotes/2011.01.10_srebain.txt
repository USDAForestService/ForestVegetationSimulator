Subject: Fire and Fuels Extension Update

Variants affected: All

Description:

1) A new keyword was created to allow initialization of soft/rotten down wood.  This
keyword can be used in conjunction with FuelInit, which initializes hard/sound down wood
and litter and duff.

FUELSOFT: Set the amount of soft/rotten dead down fuel in each fuel size class.  These loadings
can also be set within the StandInit table of an input FVS database.

Field 1:	Initial soft/rotten fuel load for the 0-0.25 inch class (tons/acre).
Field 2:	Initial soft/rotten fuel load for the 0.25-1 inch class (tons/acre).
Field 3:	Initial soft/rotten fuel load for the 1-3 inch class (tons/acre).
Field 4:	Initial soft/rotten fuel load for the 3-6 inch class (tons/acre).
Field 5:	Initial soft/rotten fuel load for the 6-12 inch class (tons/acre).
Field 6:	Initial soft/rotten fuel load for the 12-20 inch class (tons/acre).
Field 7:	Initial soft/rotten fuel load for the 20-35 inch class (tons/acre).
Field 8:	Initial soft/rotten fuel load for the 35-50 inch class (tons/acre).
Field 9:	Initial soft/rotten fuel load for the > 50 inch class (tons/acre).

2) The FVS_StandInit input data table structure has changed slightly.  Originally surface fuel was entered
through the following columns:

Fuel_0_25	-	Initial tons per acre of 0 to 0.25 inch fuel 
Fuel_25_1	-	Initial tons per acre of 0.25 to 1 inch fuel 
Fuel_0_1	-	Initial tons per acre of 0 to 1 inch fuel, if not using previous two fields
Fuel_1_3	-	Initial tons per acre of 1 to 3 inch fuel
Fuel_3_6	-	Initial tons per acre of 3 to 6 inch fuel
Fuel_6_12	-	Initial tons per acre of 6 to 12 inch fuel
Fuel_12_20 or Fuel_gt_12 -	Initial tons per acre of 12 to 20 inch fuel.  
                            (If both columns are present, the first is used.)
Fuel_20_35	-	Initial tons per acre of 20 to 35 inch fuel
Fuel_35_50	-	Initial tons per acre of 35 to 50 inch fuel
Fuel_gt_50	-	Initial tons per acre of greater than 50 inch fuel

Now the columns are as follows:
Fuel_0_25_H	-	Initial tons per acre of 0 to 0.25 inch hard/sound fuel 
Fuel_25_1_H	-	Initial tons per acre of 0.25 to 1 inch hard/sound fuel 
Fuel_1_3_H	-	Initial tons per acre of 1 to 3 inch hard/sound fuel
Fuel_3_6_H	-	Initial tons per acre of 3 to 6 inch hard/sound fuel
Fuel_6_12_H	-	Initial tons per acre of 6 to 12 inch hard/sound fuel
Fuel_12_20_H -	Initial tons per acre of 12 to 20 inch hard/sound fuel.  
Fuel_20_35_H	-	Initial tons per acre of 20 to 35 inch hard/sound fuel
Fuel_35_50_H	-	Initial tons per acre of 35 to 50 inch hard/sound fuel
Fuel_gt_50_H	-	Initial tons per acre of greater than 50 inch hard/sound fuel
Fuel_0_25_S	-	Initial tons per acre of 0 to 0.25 inch soft/rotten fuel 
Fuel_25_1_S	-	Initial tons per acre of 0.25 to 1 inch soft/rotten fuel 
Fuel_1_3_S	-	Initial tons per acre of 1 to 3 inch soft/rotten fuel
Fuel_3_6_S	-	Initial tons per acre of 3 to 6 inch soft/rotten fuel
Fuel_6_12_S	-	Initial tons per acre of 6 to 12 inch soft/rotten fuel
Fuel_12_20_S -	Initial tons per acre of 12 to 20 inch soft/rotten fuel.  
Fuel_20_35_S	-	Initial tons per acre of 20 to 35 inch soft/rotten fuel
Fuel_35_50_S	-	Initial tons per acre of 35 to 50 inch soft/rotten fuel
Fuel_gt_50_S	-	Initial tons per acre of greater than 50 inch soft/rotten fuel

This change is backward compatible.  Databases with the old fuels columns will work fine. In this case,
the tons/acre will all be put in the hard surface fuel classes and the soft decay classes will be 0.
    
Impact on users:
In most cases, this will have no impact on output.  Users initializing their surface fuels by
selecting a photo series photo (FuelFoto keyword) may notice small changes in output.
