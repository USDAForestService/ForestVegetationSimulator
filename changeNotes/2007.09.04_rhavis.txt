Subject: VOLEQNUM Keyword update and numerical error trap.
Name: R. Havis
Date: 4 Sep. 2007
Variants affected: Southeast Alaska/Coastal British Columbia (AK), Blue Mountain (BM),
                   Inland California/Southern Cascades (CA), Central Idaho (CI),
      Central Rockies (CR), East Cascades (EC), Eastern Montana (EM), Inland Empire (IE),
      Kootenai/Kaniksu/Tally Lake (KooKanTL) (KT), Klamath Mountains (NC), 
      Northern Idaho (NI), Pacific Northwest Coast (PN), Southeast (SE), Southern (SN),
      South Central Oregon/Northeast California (SO), Tetons (TT), Utah (UT),
      Westside Cascades (WC), Western Sierra Nevada (WS)

Description:
1) The VOLEQNUM keyword did not function correctly when the forest code 
   was absent from the input data. This has been corrected. In the volume
   equation number table, Behre equation numbers for Region 6 were 
   showing species FIA codes when default formclass (80) was being used.
   This has been changed such that species code 999 is shown when default
   Behre equations are used. (AK, BM, CA, CI, CR, EC, EM, IE, KT, NC,
   NI, PN, SE, SN, SO, TT, UT, WC and WS)
   
2) A potential numerical error was avoided in assigning missing crown
   ratios to dead trees in the input data. (AK, BM, CI, CR, EC, KT, IE,
   NC, NI, SO, TT, UT, and WS)

Impact on users: Users should obtain new executables.
