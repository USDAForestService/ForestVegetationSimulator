Description: Replaced ODBC-based code with SQLite-only code in the database extension. 

Impact on users: When using this version of the database extension, the file name
specified on the DSNIn and DSNOut keywords will be interpreted as an SQLite3 database
regardless of the line ending. Specification of an ODBC connection string would likely
cause an error. 

Files: 
1. makefile: building with SQLite-only is added.
2. all files in .../dbsqlite are new, those in .../dbs are not used when the SQLite-only 
versions are used.
3. a set of source_List files were added that provide for the new code.
