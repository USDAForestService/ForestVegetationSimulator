Description: 

         1) The VOLEQNUM keyword may be used to set the cubic foot
            and board foot volume equation for one or more species
            species in a simulation. When the board foot equation
            was set to a different value than the cubic foot equation
            in the affected variants, the cubic foot equation was used
            for the board foot calculations. This could result in
            zero board foot volumes, depending on the cubic foot
            equation used. This has been corrected.

         2) see 2010.07.07_rhavis for description of SDICALC
         
         3) The climate extension mortality function was not being accessed
            in the SO variant. This has been corrected.

         4) The TREESZCP keyword was being applied twice to ponderosa
            pine in the TT variant. This has been corrected.

Impact on users:

          1) Users of the VOLEQNUM keyword with the CA, EM, IE, NI, WS
             variants should obtain new executables.

          2) The SDICALC keyword is available for use in the AK, AN, BM,
             CA, CS, CR, EC, EM, LS, NC, NE, SN, SO, TT, UT,and WS vraiants
          
          3) SORNEC Climate extension users should obtain a new executable.

          4) Users of the TT variant shold obtain a new executable.
