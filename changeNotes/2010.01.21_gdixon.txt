Variants affected: UT

Description: At the request of R4, this variant was expanded from 14 to 24
             species. Equations and coefficients for the additional species
are from the Utah, Central Rockies, and South Central Oregon / Northeast
California variants. The expanded species list and surrogate equations are
as follows:

C     1 = WHITEBARK PINE               WB  PINUS ALBICAULIS
C     2 = LIMBER PINE                  LM  PINUS FLEXILIS
C     3 = DOUGLAS-FIR                  DF  PSEUDOTSUGA MENZIESII
C     4 = WHITE FIR                    WF  ABIES CONCOLOR
C     5 = BLUE SPRUCE                  BS  PICEA PUNGENS
C     6 = QUAKING ASPEN                AS  POPULUS TREMULOIDES
C     7 = LODGEPOLE PINE               LP  PINUS CONTORTA
C     8 = ENGELMANN SPRUCE             ES  PICEA ENGELMANNII
C     9 = SUBALPINE FIR                AF  ABIES LASIOCARPA
C    10 = PONDEROSA PINE               PP  PINUS PONDEROSA
C    11 = COMMON PINYON                PI  PINUS EDULIS
C    12 = WESTERN JUNIPER              WJ  JUNIPERUS OCCIDENTALIS
C    13 = GAMBEL OAK                   GO  QUERCUS GAMBELII
C    14 = SINGLELEAF PINYON            PM  PINUS MONOPHYLLA
C    15 = ROCKY MOUNTAIN JUNIPER       RM  JUNIPERUS SCOPULORUM
C    16 = UTAH JUNIPER                 UJ  JUNIPERUS OSTEOSPERMA
C    17 = GREAT BASIN BRISTLECONE PINE GB  PINUS LONGAEVA
C    18 = NARROWLEAF COTTONWOOD        NC  POPULUS ANGUSTIFOLIA
C    19 = FREMONT COTTONWOOD           FC  POPULUS FREMONTII
C    20 = CURL-LEAF MOUNTAIN-MAHOGANY  MC  CERCOCARPUS LEDIFOLIUS
C    21 = BIGTOOTH MAPLE               BI  ACER GRANDIDENTATUM
C    22 = BOXELDER                     BE  ACER NEGUNDO
C    23 = OTHER SOFTWOODS              OS
C    24 = OTHER HARDWOODS              OH

C VARIANT EXPANSION:
C GO AND OH USE OA (OAK SP.) EQUATIONS FROM UT
C PM USES PI (COMMON PINYON) EQUATIONS FROM UT
C RM AND UJ USE WJ (WESTERN JUNIPER) EQUATIONS FROM UT
C GB USES BC (BRISTLECONE PINE) EQUATIONS FROM CR
C NC, FC, AND BE USE NC (NARROWLEAF COTTONWOOD) EQUATIONS FROM CR
C MC USES MC (CURL-LEAF MTN-MAHOGANY) EQUATIONS FROM SO
C BI USES BM (BIGLEAF MAPLE) EQUATIONS FROM SO
C OS USES OT (OTHER SP.) EQUATIONS FROM UT

This expansion includes components associated with FVSut.exe (base model, partial
regeneration establishment model, cover, dwarf mistletoe, econ, and ffe). It does
not include additional components associated with FVSutx.exe (Douglas-fir beetle,
Douglas-fir tussock moth, mountain pine beetle, root disease, and budworm).


Impact on users: Users should obtain a new executable and a new variant overview
                 document.  Results for projections of the original 13 species 
in this variant may be slightly different due to miscellaneous error corrections
or updated equations. Results reported as the original "other" (OT) species
may be different due to some of the trees that may have been in this grouping 
originally may be reported as a different species now (e.g. other hardwoods). 

One major impact on users is that all site index values should now be entered on
the site curves base-age basis. In the previous version of this variant, most site
index values were on a 50-year age basis regardless of the site curves base age.
This means that any SITECODE keywords in existing runstreams need to be changed so
the site index value corresponds to the site curves base-age for that species.
