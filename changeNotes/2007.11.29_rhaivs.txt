Subject: KT variant forest code, SN-FFE biomass Eqs.
Name: R. Havis
Date: November 29, 2007
Variants affected: KT and SN

Description: 1) The default KODFOR variable was not being correctly set in the KT variant.
                This has been corrected. 
             2) The Jenkins biomass equation mapping was corrected for redcedar and
                other softwoods.

Impact on users: Users of the KT variant and the SN-FFE extension should obtain new
                 executables.
