Subject: Upgrade of the Blue Mountains variant to 18 species

Variants affected: BM

Description: At the request of R6, the Blue Mountains variant has been expanded from
             its original 10 species to 18 species. Surrogate equations from other  
             variants were used for this expansion. Western juniper, limber pine, and  
             quaking aspen originally came from the Utah variant with WJ and AS being
             via the SO33 variant; whitebark pine is originally from the Tetons variant
             via SO33; Pacific yew, Alaska cedar, black cottonwood, and other hardwoods
             are originally from the WC variant with PY, CW, and OH via SO33. In addition,
             other softwoods now uses the BM ponderosa pine growth equations rather than
             equations originally fit to the other softwoods category.


Impact on users: Users of the BM variant should obtain a new executable.
