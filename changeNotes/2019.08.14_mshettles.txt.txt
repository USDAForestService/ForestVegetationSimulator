Subject: Addition of the Regeneration Tables to the Database Extension
Name: Mike Shettles
Date: 08/14/2019
Variants affected: All

Description: The 5 tables that are produced with usage of the full establishment model,
and 3 when using the partial esablisghment model, have been added to the database 
extension code for the Q-family. The DB-FVS keyword that triggers this is RegRepts. 
The 5 table names are:

1)FVS_Regen_Sprouts
2)FVS_Regen_SitePrep
3)FVS_Regen_HabType
4)FVS_Regen_Tally
5)FVS_Regen_Ingrowth

Impact on users:This will primarily affect FVSOnline/Onlocal user's, 
allowing them to select the tables as outputs, once the Shiny code is subsequently
updated (next step).
