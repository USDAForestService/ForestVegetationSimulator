Subject: Lake States Fire and Fuels Extension and new FFE keywords

Variants affected: ALL FFE variants

Description:
The Fire and Fuels Extension to FVS has been calibrated for the Lake States area.

Because LS-FFE uses the native plant community in its fuel model selection logic,
native plant community codes should be set for stands using LS-FFE.  The native plant
community codes are from:

Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (2003).  Field Guide to the Native Plant
Communities of Minnesota: the Laurentian Mixed Forest Province.  Ecological Land
Classification Program, Minnesota County Biological Survey, and Natural Heritage
and Nongame Research Program.  MNDNR St. Paul, MN.

The NPC codes are as follows:

  1:{FDn12 Northern Dry-Sand Pine Woodland}
  2:{FDn22 Northern Dry-Bedrock Pine (Oak) Woodland}
  3:{FDn32 Northern Poor Dry-Mesic Mixed Woodland}

Users of LS-FFE should set these codes in their stand list file, input database,
or thru the StdInfo keyword. 
 
The LS fuel model logic uses the season of the burn to determine the fuel model
and in its fire-related mortality predictions.  As a result, a new keyword, 
POTFSEAS, was created so that users can control the season of potential fires.  
Also, a new field was added to the SimFire keyword so that users can control 
the season of simulated fires.  The season of the fire does not affect FFE for 
other variants.

Also, the keyword POTFPAB was created so that users can control the percentage of
the stand area that is assumed burned for potential fires, which is used in the 
fire effect calculations.  (There is already a way to control this for simulated 
fires.)

The new and altered FFE keywords:

POTFPAB - controls the percentage of the stand area burned for potential fire
calculations.  
Field 1: percentage of the stand area burned for potential severe fires;
          default is 100%.
Field 2: percentage of the stand area burned for potential moderate fires;
          default is 100%.

POTFSEAS - controls the season of the burn for potential fire calculations.
           (Currently used in LS-FFE only.)
Field 1: season of the burn for potential severe fires.
           1 = early spring (compact leaves), 2 = before greenup, 
           3 = after greenup (before fall), 4 = fall
          default is 1.
Field 2: season of the burn for potential moderate fires.
           1 = early spring (compact leaves), 2 = before greenup, 
           3 = after greenup (before fall), 4 = fall 
          default is 1.

SIMFIRE - signals that a fire and its effects should be simulated and specify 
some of the environmental conditions for the fire.
Field 1: the FVS cycle number or the calendar year; default is 1.
Field 2: Windspeed in miles per hour 20 ft. above the vegetation; default is 20.
Field 3: Nominal moisture level.  If the MOISTURE keyword is used, the value in 
         this field is ignored; the default is 1=very dry.
Field 4: Temperate (F); default is 70.
Field 5: Mortality Code.  0 = Turn off FFE mortality predictions, 1 = FFE estimates mortality.
Field 6: Percentage of stand area burned; default is 100.
Field 7: Season of the burn.  1 = early spring (compact leaves), 2 = before greenup, 
         3 = after greenup (before fall), 4 = fall; default is 1. (Used in LS-FFE only.)
 
Impact on users:
There should be no change in output.  LS-FFE users will need to download the latest
versions of Suppose and FVS.  Other FFE users should download new software if they 
want to use the new POTFPAB keyword.
