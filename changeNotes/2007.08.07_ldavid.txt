Subject: Dead tree expansion factor on input tree data
Name: Lance R. David
Date: August 7, 2007
Variants affected: ALL western variants with LPMPB extension

Description:

An expansion factor applied by FVS to dead trees in the input tree data was
not properly addressed in the Lodgepole Mountain Pine Beetle model leading
to over-representation of current MPB mortality. Added code for UNexpansion
of dead tree TPA. An explanation of the TPA expansion is in base\src\notre.f.

Impact on users:

1) MPB model impacts will be less severe when initializing current MPB
   mortality from inventory (LPMPB keyword InvMort) and initiating an 
   outbreak in cycle 1.

Files:

lpmpb\src\mpsdlp.f - added PLOT.F77 common file. Added code for UNexpansion of dead tree TPA.

lpmpb\obj\makefile - added PLOT.F77 common file to mpsdlp dependency list.
