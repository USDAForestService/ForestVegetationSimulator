Subject: Default Behre's Hyperbola Form Factor Values
Name: Mike Shettles
Date: 3/30/2015
Variants affected: CA, NC, PN and WC

Description: The default form factor values for use with Behre's Hyperobla profile
model were changed from the values to be used with a 32' log to a 16' log equation.

Impact on users: Users should be aware that the default form factor values for the 
species whose defaul volume equation is Behre's hyperbola are now based upon the 
16' log equation (616BEHW***), and no longer the 32' log equation (632BEHW***) for 
the USFS location codes in these four variants. Download new exectuables to obtain 
the latest volume estimates.
