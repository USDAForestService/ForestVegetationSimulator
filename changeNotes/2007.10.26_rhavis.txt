Description: The generation of an FVS Error message was added to
             the main output file when an OPEN keyword tries
             to open a .KCP or .ADD file that does not exist

Impact on users: New OPEN keyword diagnostic error report.

Files:
./base/src/errgro.f - added FVS ERROR31
./base/src/keyopn.f - force file open status "old" for .kcp and .add files
                      and generate FVS ERROR31 message when file does not exist
