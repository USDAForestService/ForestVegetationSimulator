Subject: R3 woodland species volumes
Name: R. Havis
Date: June 27, 2016
Variants affected: CR

Description: After April 11, 2016 the woodland species volumes in Region 3
             were using a multi-stem parameter in volume calculations.
             This was changed so all volumes for Region 3 woodland 
             are calculated assuming a single stem.
             
Impact on users: Woodland species volumes in Regions 3 will be approximately
                 10% higher than volumes calculated using Version 1108 of the
                 Central Rockies Variant
