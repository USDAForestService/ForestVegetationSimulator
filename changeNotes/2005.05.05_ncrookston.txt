Subject: PPE updates for fire
Name: Nick Crookston
Date: 2005.05.05
Variants affected: All with PPE and Fire

Description: Added a "fire" flag to the PPE_FFESelData.txt file, improved
the processing of the RDACCESS file.

Impact on users: None except those 2 groups using PPE/FFE

Added a console message when external SYSTEM calls are made.

Files:
ppbase/src/hvproj.f -- write added variable
ppbase/src/hvaloc.f -- write added variable in header
ppbase/src/hvsel.f  --  added print statement
ppbase/src/sprdrd.f -- changed processing in the case when the
  rdaccess file is being read after all the stands have been defined.
  Now, stands in the rdaccess file that are not in the simulation are
  skipped.
