Subject: Removing SORNEC 11 species variant code
Name: R. Havis
Date: July 9, 2010
Variants affected: SO

Description: The SORNEC variant species list was expended from 11 to
             33 species, and the variant was released to users in June
             of 2005. Since that time the expanded 33 species variant has been
             identified in the FVS directory structure as SO33 and the older 11
             species variant has been maintained as SO. This update removes the
             SORNEC 11 species variant-specific code and identifies the SORNEC 33
             species variant code with the SO abbreviation.
             
             The process to update the FVS source code was to copy the SO33 variant
             code into the so directories and to delete the so33 directories. In updating
             current working copies from the SVN repository, it may be necessary to manually
             delete the following directories after the update.
             
             fvs/so33
             fvs/ppso33
             fvs/dbs/so33
             fvs/clim/so33
             fvs/dbs/obj/so33

Impact on users: None

Files:

makefiles - the process for modifying the makefiles generally involved changing
            paths names from so33 to so. The obj/makefiles for variants that use
            so/r6crwd, avht40 were modified to compile these routines.

          - The so/DUBSCR routine was moved to the EC source directory, and the
            obj/makefiles that use this routine were modified to compile ec/dubscr

./ak/obj/makefile - remaned paths involving so33 to so
./base/src/svstart.f - modified comments
./bin/makefile - removed references to so33
