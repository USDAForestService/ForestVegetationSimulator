Variants affected: ALL

Description:

1) Using the FIXMORT keyword, with diameter limits to kill all trees, rounding
   caused residual trees in growth loops with zero PROB array values. A tolerance
   was added to the conditional statement which compared equality of real numbers.

2) see Volume Estimator Library Bulletin No. V0149_120308.
   Default was added for height to first live limb.
   Ponderosa pine BF values (large trees) will be slightly affected.

                     criterion to upper bound in real value equivalence
                     in FIXMORT conditional statements.
