Name:  Stephanie Rebain
Date:  6/15/2010
Variants affected: CR

Description:
This updates the crown biomass estimates for ponderosa pine in the Black Hills 
and Nebraska National Forests in the Central Rockies variant.

This version has new estimates of foliage and 0-.25" branchwood based on:

Keyser, Tara, and Frederick W. Smith.  2009.  Influence of Crown Biomass Estimators and 
Distribution on Canopy Fuel Characteristics in Ponderosa Pine Stands of the Black
Hills.  Forest Science 56(2):156-165.

Impact on Users:
CR-FFE users on these national forests should obtain new executables.

Modified Files:

fire/base/src/fmcroww.f -  added entry 25 for Black Hills ponderosa pine
fire/base/src/fmpocr.f -  changed code so that the way the canopy material 
                          is distributed follows the logic in Keyser and Smith
fire/cr/src/fmcrow.f -  made edits so that for the Black Hills and Nebraska NF,
                        equation 25 is called for ponderosa pine instead of 13;
                        added PLOT.F77 to the common block
fire/cr/obj/makefile -  added PLOT.F77 as an include file for cr/fmcrow
metric/fire/cr/obj/makefile -  added PLOT.F77 as an include file for cr/fmcrow
