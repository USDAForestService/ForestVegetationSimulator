Variants affected: Klammath Mountains (NC), West Cascades (WC)

Description: A debug format statement was corrected in WC. 
             The NC variant now has its own DUBSCR routine. NC previously used 
             the DUBSCR routine from the EC variant. The EC variant is now being
             expanded to 32 species.
