Variants affected: All variants

Description: The treelist clean-up process in cuts.f was placing minimal TPA
             records in the cutlist that were outside specified size range of 
             cutting activity. Added condition where record must have already
             been targetted for some removal to qualify.
             Detailed snag report to SQLite output database is working.

Impact on users: Invalid tree records of minimal TPA no longer can appear in 
            cutlist. FFE Detailed snage repoprt to SQLite output database is
            now working.
