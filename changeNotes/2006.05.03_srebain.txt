Subject: Fire and Fuels Extension - Northeast Variant
Name:  Stephanie Rebain
Date:  05/03/2006
Variants affected: Northeast (NE)

Description:
The Fire and Fuels Extension was calibrated for the Northeast variant of FVS.
This version is a stripped-down version with only slim fuel model selection 
rules.  As a result, users are highly encouraged to specifically set a fuel
model with the FuelModl keyword when running NE-FFE.

Impact on users:
This is a new feature for NE FVS users.
FFE will be available for selection with the NE variant in the next version
of Suppose.
These changes are documented in the FFE addendum document.
