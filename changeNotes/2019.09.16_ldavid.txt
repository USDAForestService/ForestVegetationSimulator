Variants affected: All variants

Description: Calculation of MAX SDI for each sample point weighted by species
             basal area has been added to SDICAL routine. The values are stored
             in array XMAXPT that has beed added to VARCOM common area. This was
             created for use by the regeneration model in the new Alaska varaint,
             but this array and values are available in all variants.            

Impact on users: FFE will function with new 23 species AK variant.

vbase/sdical.f  - Processing adding to SDICAL routine to compute point maximum SDI
                  weighted by species basal area. And stored in array XMAXPT for each
                  sample point.
common/varcom.f77 - Added array XMAXPT for maximum SDI by point weighted by species BA.
