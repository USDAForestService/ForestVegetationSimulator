Subject: Database Tree List Species Codes
Name: R. Havis
Date: November 18, 2013
Variants affected: ALL

Description: The objective of the this enhancement is to give a uniform
             appearance to the format of the species codes in the database
             Tree List table. When species were added to the tree list
             through the regeneration establishment extension, the species
             code appearing in the database tree list was the default
             species code format, the plants code format. This has
             been changed so that new species assume the database
             species code format of the first tree record read in
             the tree list.
             
             CI variant: Corrected a potential numerical error in REGENT.
             DG was going negative

Impact on users: Users should obtain new executables.
