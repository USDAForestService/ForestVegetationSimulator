Subject: Data Base Output and ECON Updates
Name: R. Havis - Thenks to Fred Martin (WDNR) for these code change contributions.
Date: February 15, 2008
Variants affected: ALL

Description:

1) Normal height (column label EstHt) and actual point number (column ActPt) have
   been added to the Data Base Tree List Output Table and to the After Treatment
   Tree List Table. The ECON extension allows pretend harvests that are not tracked
   in FVS accounting procedures. The pretend mode may not have been closed between
   stand simulations in serial runs. This has been corrected.
