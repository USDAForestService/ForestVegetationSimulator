Description: The Event Monitor variables ARDEN2 and, BRDEN2, and the
             SPMCDBH function (argument 1 = 12) return stand densities
             based on the SILVAH model (MARQUIS and ERNST. 1992).
             There were multiple problems with the calculations, and
             these problems have been corrected. These calculations
             are only available to users of the Northeast variant.

Impact on users:

Files:
./base/src/evldx.f   - adjusted SPMCDBH (arg1=12)  variable for stand stockable area
./base/src/evtstv.f  - adjusted ARDEN2 and BRDEN2 variables for stand stockable area
./base/src/revise.f
./base/src/sdical.f  - updated array (MAPNE) mapping species to Silvah tree-area
                       ratio equations, truncated calculations for trees < 1 in,
                       and negative relative densities, and removed BA term in
                       single tree calculations.
