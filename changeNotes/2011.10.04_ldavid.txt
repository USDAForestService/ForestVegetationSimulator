Subject: I&D extensions (DFB, LP-MPB, WRD, GenDefol) updated for Central Idaho
         variant species expansion.
Name: Lance David
Date: October 4, 2011
Variants affected: CI

Description:

1) Douglas-fir Beetle Model updated for the CI species expansion.

2) Lodgepole Mountain Pine Model updated for the CI species expansion.

3) Western Root Disease Model updated for the CI species expansion.

4) General Defoliation Model updated for the CI species expansion.

Impact on users: Users of the CI variant with I&D extensions should obtain a
                 new executable. Tree species that had previously been placed
                 in the "other" group that are now represented will be affected
                 when they had been ignored before. The new tree species and
                 groups are: 
                    whitebark pine
                    Pacific yew
                    quaking aspen
                    Western juniper
                    curlleaf mountain-mohogany
                    limber pine
                    black cotton wood
                    other softwoods
                    other hardwoods

                 Even though some tree species now represented may not be host
                 to a given insect or pathogen, their recognition and presence
                 can alter the behavior of the models.
