Subject: Region 6 and BLM Volume Equations
Name: R. Havis
Date: September 7, 2012
Variants affected: BM, CA, EC, IE, NC, NI, PN, SO, and WC

Description: The VOLEQNUM keyword may be used to select specific volume 
             equations to calculate volumes for a simulation. The set of
             volume equations available include all equations used in the
             Forest Service region. The entire set of Region 6 volume
             equations have been made available for use in all BLM and BIA
             forests. The BLM volume equations have also been made available
             for use in Region 6 forests. Potential processing errors were
             avoided if zero is used in field 1 of the ESTAB keyword.

Impact on users: Users simulating BLM and BIA forests may use the VOLEQNUM
                 keyword to select Region 6 volume equations to calculate
                 volumes. Users simulating Region 6 forests may select
                 BLM volume equations using the VOLEQNUM keyword.
