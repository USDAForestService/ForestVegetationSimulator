Variants affected: code cleanup  IE, UT
                   coefficient correction IE
                   SETSITE keyword enhancement: all variants

Description: Deleted unused coefficients for Aspen (UT and IE), paper birch (IE), and mountain maple (IE).
             These were in arrays DGFOR, DGDS, DGCASP, DGSASP, and DGSLOP, in subroutine DGF.
             
             Corrected the DGEL2 coefficient for paper birch from -0.000943 to 0.0 in subroutine DGF for
             the IE variant.
             
             Redesigned the SETSITE keyword and added two new fields. The keyword now looks like this:
             
             field 1: year or cycle in which the parameter will be changed (default 1)
             field 2: habitat type, plant association, or ecological unit (must be numeric; enter
                      numeric sequence number for plant association or ecol unit) (default blank = no change)
             field 3: basal area maximum (default blank = no change)
             field 4: species code or species group name (default  All)
             field 5: site index, or percent change in site index for the species indicated in
                      field 4 (default  blank = no change)
             field 6: site index flag. 0 or blank if the value in field 5 is a site index value; 1 if the
                      value in field 5 is a percent change. (default  blank = site index value)
             field 7: Stand Density Index (SDI) maximum for the species indicated in field 4.
             

Impact on users: No impact on UT users.  Very minor impact on IE users simulating paper birch.
