Subject: shading adjustment PLANT and NATURAL Keywords,
         species codes FVS_ECONHarvestValue data base table
Name: R. Havis
Date: May 22, 2008
Variants affected: ALL

Description:

     1) When using the PLANT or NATURAL keywords, users have the option of
        distributing seedlings throughout the stand, favoring shaded plots,
        or favoring sunny plots. The shading adjustment has been modified
        to have more of an effect.

     2) Species code format control was implemented in the FVS_ECON_HarvestValue
        data base table with FVS Update Buletin No. 690. There was a problem with
        the specis codes in this table for the AK, CA, CR, CS, IE, LS, NE, PN,
        SN, SO, UT, and WC variants. This has been corrected.

Impact on users: Users utilizing the shade preference code on the PLANT or 
                 NATURAL keywords (field 7) should obtain a new executable.
                 Users of the ECON extension in the variants listed in No. 2 above
                 should obtain new executables
