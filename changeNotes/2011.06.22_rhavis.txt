Subject: Array Sorting After Call to COMPRS
Name: R. Havis
Date: June 22, 2011
Variants affected: ALL

Description: 
             
1) Tree list compression is required to make room for trees introduced from the establishment
   extension, and also to reduce the tree list to a number that the Western Root Disease extension
   can process. Tree list compression can also be scheduled using the COMPRESS keyword.
   In the cases where tree list compression was called from the establishment extensions,
   the arrays maintaining species and tree record diameter sorting were not being re-established.
   This has been corrected.
   
2) FVS maintains PV Code / PV Reference Code cross walks to map the PV Code / PV Reference
   Code sets from FSveg to codes understood by FVS. The PV Code / PV Reference
   Code cross walk for the BM variant was updated. PV Reference Codes 622, 640 and 639
   having a CJ plant association were mapped to FVS Code CPG111.
             
Impact on users: In rare cases, problems with the pointer arrays could cause processing problems.
                 Users of the BM variant should obtain a new executable.
