Subject: Crown dubbing in variants having a Weibull-based crown model

Variants affected:AK, BM, CA, CI, EC, EM, IE, NC, PN, SN, SO, TT, UT, WC, WS

Description: In variants using the Weibull distribution to dub crown ratios on trees 
             with DBH 1.0" and larger, the relative SDI was not being computed before
             crown dubbing was taking place. This affected the computation of average
             crown ratio and therefore the Weibull distribution from which crown ratios
             were being assigned. This has been corrected.

Impact on users:  Users of the AK, BM, CA, CI, EC, EM, IE, NC, PN, SN, SO, TT, UT, WC,
                  and WS variants need to obtain a new executable. Projections may be 
                  slightly affected by this change.

Files:
base/src 
   main.f       changed the date of revision; added a call to subroutine SDICLS to calculate 
                SDI just before the call to subroutine CRATET
                
xx/src          where xx = AK, AN, BM, CA, CI, EC, EM, IE, NC, PN, SN, SO, TT, UT, WC, WS
   crown.f      changed the date of revision; modified the debug write section echoing
                the IND and ISORT arrays
