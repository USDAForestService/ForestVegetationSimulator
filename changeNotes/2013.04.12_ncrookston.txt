Subject: API interface to SVS objects
Name: Nick Crookston
Date: April 12, 2013
Variants affected: All

Description: Added API calls to support interaction with the SVS objects. 

Impact on users: None unless someone is using the features.

SVS keyword impact: Added a flag on field 3 that suppresses the actual
writting of the image files yet turns on the SVS calculations.
