Subject: THINRDSL keyword addtion
Name: Gary Dixon
Date:01/24/2008
Variants affected:all variants to some extent, but mainly the NE, and NE_NEW variants since these will be the only variants
where this keyword will be valid (at least initially)

Description: Allows users to thin to a relative density target as defined in the SILVAH growth and yield model. SILVAH is
the model built for the Northeastern U.S. by research and still broadly used today.

Impact on users: No impact on current users. Change will provide additional functionality

common changes
VARCOM.F77  added variable ISILFT to carry the computed SILVAH forest type
OPCOM.F77   expanded the dimensions of TSTV1 to 49 and TSTV2 to 32

source code file changes
base/src/algkey.f    expanded the dimension of N6 to 35 and inserted event monitor variables BRDEN2 and ARDEN2 to carry the
                     before and after silvah relative density values; expanded the dimension of N8 to 34 and inserted the
                     event monitor variable SILVAHFT to carry the calculated silvah forest type.
base/src/cuts.f      added logic to process the THINRDSL keyword
base/src/evldx.f     added the calculation of silvah relative density as the 12th attribute of the SPMCDBH function
base/src/evtstv.f    added the common block VARCOM; inserted code to compute the event monitor variables BRDEN2, ARDEN2, and
                     SILVAHFT
base/src/grincr.f    inserted the common block VARCOM; inserted a calls to entry SILFTY to calculate the silvah forest type
                     before and after thinning
base/src/sdical.f    added the common block VARCOM; added entry RDCLS2 to calculate the silvah relative density value for the
                     stand; added entry RDSLTR to calculate the contribution of an individual tree to the silvah relative density
                     value; added entry SILFTY to calculate the silvah forest type.

dbs/src/dbsin.f      changed DBS ECON report keyword from ECON to ECONRPTS
