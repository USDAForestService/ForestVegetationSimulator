Please download new copies of the following routines.

./ni/src/spctrn.f    - expanded this routine to be an all western variants routine,
                       thus laying the groundwork for better translation or FIA
                       codes to alpha species codes in the future. Also, makes L
                       and WL recognized for western Larch, S and ES recognized
                       for Engelmann spruce, C and RC recognized for western red
                       cedar, and J and JU recognized for western juniper in
                       variants where this is still and issue (data input only,
                       not on keywords).
./cs/src/sitset.f    - For the Mark Twain NF, merchantability specs entered for
                       cycle 0 via keyword were being overwritten by the default
                       merch specs for the Mark Twain.  Moved the setting of the
                       default merch specs from grinit to sitset to correct this
                       problem.
./cs/src/grinit.f    - see above
./sn/src/findag.f    - logic was corrected so trees exceeding the calculated maximum
                       height were assigned the correct age when FINDAG is called
                       from CRATET.  This problem was discovered by Don
                       Vandendriesche when calculating stand age in cycle 0, based
                       on input tree heights using an algorithm not in production.
                       This will not affect other basic model calculations.
./base/src/stkval.f  - Tree species FIA codes are used as an index to Arner's (2001)
                       initial type groups and stocking equations.  These are used
                       to estimate size and stocking class and forest type
                       (in FORTYP) appearing in Summary Statistics table.  Species
                       having no valid FIA code are assigned three dashes ('---').
                       This code is now assigned an initial type group of 998 other
                       hardwoods (OH) rather than non stocked (initial type group
                       999).  Other cedars in the NE variant were not indexed and
                       are now assigned initial type group 60.  The initial type
                       group of other pines (NE) was changed from 52 to 42.  Other
                       changes were made in the indexing system to accommodate the
                       changes to the FIA codes described below.
./base/src/revise.f
./ls/src/spctrn.f    - changes in FIA codes and alpha codes were made to accommodate
                       the changes described below.

The changes to the BLKDAT routines are described in the table below.

./se/src/blkdat.f
./wc/src/blkdat.f
./ws/src/blkdat.f
./pn/src/blkdat.f
./ne/src/blkdat.f
./nc/src/blkdat.f

./cs/src/blkdat.f
./ca/src/blkdat.f
./ak/src/blkdat.f
./ie/src/blkdat.f
./sn/src/blkdat.f

The following table shows the FIA and ALPHA code changes made in the
indicated BLKDAT routines.  The '---' codes are used for species
that have no valid FIA code.  See explanation for STKVAL, above.
