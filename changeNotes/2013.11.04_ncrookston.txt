Variants affected: All western

Description: 

This modification makes the climate model "modifier" keywords activities so 
that they can be scheduled. The changes are to: MORTMULT, AUTOESTB, MXDENMLT, 
and GROWMULT. The "parms" feature for these keywords has also been implimented. 

Impact on users: 
All "old" Climate-FVS keyword files that use these keywords need to be edited 
to treat the first field as a YEAR or CYCLE number according to typical FVS 
conventions. Beyond that, the change makes the program more powerful.

Files:
base/src/oplist.f : added activitiy codes and keyword callback for CLKEY.
clim/base/src/clmaxden.f : modified to process the MXDENMLT activity
clim/base/src/clauestb.f : modified to process the AUTOESTB activity
clim/base/src/clmorts.f : modified to process the MORTMULT activity
clim/base/src/clgmlt.f : modified to process the GROWMULT activity
