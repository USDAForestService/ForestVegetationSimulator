Subject: Fire and Fuels Extension Update

Variants affected: All

Description:
Two new FFE reports are available in both text and database format.  The two reports
output down woody debris volume (cuft/acre) and down woody debris percent cover (%) by size class
and decay class (hard/soft).  An associated event monitor function is also available.

NEW FIRE AND FUELS EXTENSION KEYWORDS

DWDVLOut 	     Request the down woody debris volume report.
field 1:       The FVS cycle number or the calendar year when the output
               starts; default is 1.
field 2:       Number of years to output; default is 200.
field 3:       Interval to output; default is 1 (every year).

DWDCVOut	     Request the down woody debris cover report.
field 1:       the FVS cycle number or the calendar year when the output
               starts; default is 1.
field 2:       Number of years to output; default is 200.
field 3:       Interval to output; default is 1 (every year). 

NEW DATABASE EXTENSION KEYWORDS

DWDVLOut 
field 1: 1 = both database and standard output are requested
         2 = database output only
         (default is 1)

DWDCVOut 
field 1: 1 = both database and standard output are requested
         2 = database output only
         (default is 1)

NEW EVENT MONITOR FUNCTION

DWDVal(arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4) returns the volume (cuft/acre) and percent cover (%) 
of down woody debris, for a range of size classes and by decay class (hard/soft).
The values correspond to those reported in the two new FFE down wood reports.

arg1 = type of output desired (1 = down wood volume, 2 = down wood cover)
arg2 = decay class returned (0 = all, 1 = hard, 2 = soft)
arg3 = the lower limit of the size range returned.  Values are 1-7, as follows:
       1 = 0-3 in, 2 = 3-6 in, 3 = 6-12 in, 4 = 12-20 in, 
       5 = 20-35 in, 6 = 35-50 in, 7 = >=50 in.
arg4 = the upper limit of the size range returned. (Values match those used for arg3.)

The value of arg3 and arg4 can be the same and if this is the case, the value for that single
category will result.  

Impact on Users:
Users interested in the new reports should obtain new variant executables as well as
the latest version of the Suppose interface.  These new features are documented in the
Fire and Fuels Extension documentation, Database Extension User's Guide, and Essential 
FVS Guide.

New Files:
dbs/src/dbsfmdwvol.f - new subroutine to output FFE down wood volume to database
