Subject: Bug fix for height dubbing coefficients undefined in the case
         where the only tree record(s) for a species are all dead trees. 
Name: Gary Dixon
Date: 12/03/03
Variants affected: All variants

Description: If the only tree records for a species are all coded as dead
trees, then in most variants the height dubbing coefficients could be 
undefined, or wrongly defined, in the section of code which dubs heights
on dead tree records. Code was inserted in this section to correctly 
define the coefficients.  Also, some general code cleanup involving the
variable IABFLG() and initialization of the AA and BB arrays was done.

Impact on users: This case probably only occurs in a very limited number 
of stands. However, all users should obtain a new executable.

Files: CRATET for each of the variants except PN (which uses the WC CRATET).
