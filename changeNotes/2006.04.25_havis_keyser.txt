Subject: SPROUT Generation Algorithm
Name: Havis/Keyser
Date: April 25, 2006
Variants affected: CR

Description: New sprouts are generated when cutting or fire is simulated. The predicted number of
             sprouts per stem was excessive when disturbance the cycle length exceeded 10 years.
             This has been corrected.

Impact on users: Users who set the cycle length greater than 10 years, and who expect sprout
                 generation in their simulations should obtain a new executable.
