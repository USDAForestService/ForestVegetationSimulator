Description:

1) In testing the Central Rockies variant, certain conditional sequences caused a run time error.
   ESSA Inc., under contract to the FMSC, detected these problems using their build system and
   slightly modified the semantics of the IF-ENDIF conditionals to process without error.
   This problem may not have bee symptomatic on all build systems.
   
 2) A variable was added to the climate model code to facilitate programming of the
    Prognosis BC variant climate extension.

 3) A run-time error was corrected in the climate extension, and zeros were made acceptable
    in data base Fields for the DG_Measure and HTG_Measure variables.


Impact on users: A potential run-time error in climate extension was corrected, and zeros
                 are now allowable for the DG_Measure and HTG_Measure variables in data base
                 input tables.

Files:
./base/src/svrmov.f - changed IF-ENDIF semantics
./clim/base/src/clgmult.f - Fixed logic error that was causing growth to become zero
./clim/base/src/clinit.f - initialized CLHABINDX
./common/CLIMATE.F77 - added CLHABINDX
./cr/src/sitset.f - changed IF-ENDIF semantics
./dbs/src/dbsstandin.f - Set IFINT and IFINTH to default values when entered as zeros 
                         in data base.
