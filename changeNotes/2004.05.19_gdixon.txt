Subject: New DEFECT keyword
Name: Gary Dixon
Date: 05/19/04
Variants affected: All variants

Description: The BFDEFECT and MCDEFECT keywords allow users to set defect
percentages for classes up to 25" dbh. Eastern forests wanted the ability
to set defect percentages up to at least 35" dbh. They wanted the specified
defect percentages to apply to all cycles. All the fields on the BFDEFECT 
and MCDEFECT keywords were being used. To expand the diameter range but
maintain the upward compatability with BFDEFECT and MCDEFECT, I created a
new DEFECT keyword with two fields and a supplemental record. The two fields
specify the type of defect being specified (cubic or pulpwood, board or 
sawtimber, or both) and the species. The supplemental record contains 8 
fields for defect percentages up to 40" dbh. Additional supplemental records
can be added if we ever need to expand this capability beyond 40". 
Functionality of the BFDEFECT and MCDEFECT keywords is maintained, and these
keywords can be used in conjunction with the new DEFECT keyword if desired.

Impact on users: No impact. Just added functionality.
