Subject: Eastern Crown Width Calculations and the SPCODES Keyword
Name: Chad Keyser / Robert Havis
Date: May 4, 2006
Variants affected: CS, LS, NE, SE AND SN

Description: The SPCODES keyword causes the JSP array to be modified.
             This was causing incorrect associations of species with crown
             width equation in the CWCALC routine. Therefore the index associating
             species with equations was changed from JSP to NSP. 

Impact on users: Use of the SPCODES keyword will not affect crown width calculations.
