Subject: Central Rockies Fuel Model Logic and Structure Class Determination within FFE
Name: Stephanie Rebain
Date: January 24, 2005
Variants affected: All

Description: 
Changes were made to the Central Rockies fuel model logic based on input from a 
recent FFE validation workshop.  A description of these changes can be found in
the next version of the FFE documentation addendum, posted to the FVS website.  To
accomplish these changes, the way FFE obtains structure class information was changed
(structure class is often used to determine the appropriate fuel model).  In previous
versions of the code, the structure class logic was automatically turned on when
using FFE, even if not needed.  In this new code, a new entry point, fmsstage, was
created in sstage specifically so that FFE could call the structure class calculations
whenever needed and with whatever input parameters desired.

Impact on users:
There should be no changes for users not running FFE.  Central Rockies FFE users 
should obtain new executables.  There may be some output differences with other 
FFE variants where structure class is used to determine the fuel model or fuel 
loadings (TT, UT, EC, SO).

                    info whenever necessary and could use any parameters necessary.
