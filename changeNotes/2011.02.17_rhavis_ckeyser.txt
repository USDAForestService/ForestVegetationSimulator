Subject: Habitat Code Change
Name: R. Havis, C. Keyser
Date: February 17, 2011
Variants affected: EM and KT

Description: Habitat type codes are entered in the second field of the StdInfo
             keyword or in the PV_Code column of an input database. The habitat
             type code number 66 was changed to habitat type code number 65 for
             use with the KT and EM variants.

Impact on users: Users of the EM and KT variants should use habitat type code
                 number 65 rather than number 66 in the future. Before running
                 older keyword files or older input databases with a new executable,
                 users of the EM and KT variants should change any instance of
                 the habitat type code number 66 to habitat type code number 66.
