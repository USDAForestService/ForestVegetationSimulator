Description: New versions of output treelists (Treelist, Cutlist, ATRTList)
             tables in output database for ODBC were added with more
             appropriate column names. The Eastern versions of the tables
             have names ending with "_East". The column names in the new
             tables were changed in both ODBC and SQLite versions and are
             as follows:
                 West: TCuFt, MCuFt, BdFt,  Ht2TDCF,  Ht2TDBF
                 East: MCuFt, SCuFt, SBdFt, Ht2TDMCF, Ht2TDSCF

Impact on users: Easier interpretation of tables.
