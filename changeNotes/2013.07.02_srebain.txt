Subject: Fire and Fuels Extension Update
Name:  Stephanie Rebain
Date:  07/02/2013
Variants affected: All

Description:

1)  The down wood decay rates in some variants (PN, WC, BM, EC, SO, CA) were updated based on 
data from Kim Mellen-McLean, region 6 wildlife ecologist.  For the SO and CA variants, the decay rates
were updated for region 6, but not for the region 5 portion of the variant.

2)  A correction was made to the processing of the DuffProd keyword.

3) Corrections were made to the decay rates in the NC, CA, WS, and CI variants.  In these variants,
if users reset the decay rates with the FuelDcay keyword, the standard decay rate adjustments based on
habitat type (CI) or the site code (NC, CA, WS) were still being applied.  This was fixed.  Also, a 
correction was made to the amount of decayed material going to duff in these variants. 

4) The FuelMult keyword was not being processed properly in the SO variant.  This was corrected.


Impact on users:
Users of these variants may want to download new executables.
