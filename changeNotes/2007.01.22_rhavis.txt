Subject: Error Corrections
Name: R. Havis
Date: January 22, 2007
Variants affected: CS, NE and SO

Description:
1) Diameters and diameter growth estimates for trees less than 4.5 ft. are 
   assigned based on tree height. The assignment of diameter growth 
   values was corrected for softwoods having heights less than 4.5 feet in
   the CS and NE variants.

2) Large tree height growth coefficients were corrected for bigleaf maple,
   giant chinkapin, and curl-leaf maple.

Impact on users: Users should obtain new executables.

Files:
./cs/src/rgntsw.f  - corrected a subscripting error in RGNTSW in cs and ne that
                     caused trees less than 4.5 feet tall to get a diameter increment.
./ne/src/rgntsw.f  - corrected a subscripting error in RGNTSW in cs and ne that
                     caused trees less than 4.5 feet tall to get a diameter increment.
./so33/src/blkdat  - corrected large tree height growth coefficients for BM, GC and MC
./base/src/revise.f
