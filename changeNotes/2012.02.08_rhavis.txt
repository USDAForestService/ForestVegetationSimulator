Subject: Changed Volume Code File Name Convention
Name: R. Havis

Variants affected: Southern Variant

Description: The include files in the FVS volume source code used a mixture of 
             file name extensions (.FOR, .inc, .INC), and a mixture of upper and
             lower case characters in the include file names. This has been changed
             so that all FVS volume source code include files have upper case file name
             characters and use the same extension .INC. All file names
             in include statements were modified to match the include file name
             convention (i.e. all upper case). Additional code maintenance is
             described in the following section.
             
Impact on users: None

Files:

./base/src/algkey.f -  The NUM variable was initialized, NUM=0.
./common/includeSVN.f
./dbs/src/dbsprssql.f -  The call to ALGKEY (line 98) and the call to EVLDX (line 101)
                         each have 3 arguments. The corresponding ALGKEY and EVLDX routines
                         each have 4 arguments. It looks like the argument IOPKD has been
                         dropped from DBSPRSSQL but ALGKEY/EVLDX haven't been modified. 
                         To correct this, the IRC variable was added to each argument list.
                         The unused variable NUMSTR was deleted from the declarations.

./volume/src/r8vol1.f - changed names of include files to extension .INC
./volume/src/r8vol2.f - changed names of include files to extension .INC
./volume/src/r9clark.f - changed names of include files to upper case and extension .INC
./volume/src/R8DIB.FOR - deleted
./volume/src/R8CLIST.FOR - renamed to R8CLIST.INC
./volume/src/R8VLIST.FOR - renamed to R8VLIST.INC
