Variants affected: All variants

Description: These changes are part of a code modernization effort undertaken by the Forest Management 
             Service Center and follow guIdelines suggested in the "FVS Code Modernization: ConsIderations and
             Recommendations" (Gary Dixon, Final Report, 05/25/2017). Changes included in this bulletin are
             changes to make the code easier to understand and maintain.

             Specifically:
             
             1. The labelled COMMON inclusions were alphabetized.
             
             2. The variable declaration sections were formatted consistently.
             
             3. Other general cleanup.
                
Impact on users: None.
