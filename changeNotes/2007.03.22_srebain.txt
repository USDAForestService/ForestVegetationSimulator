Variants affected:
all variants with FFE (all variants except CS and AK)

Description:
A new FFE event monitor function was created.  

PotFType(arg1) returns potential fire type.
arg1 = 1 returns potential severe fire type
arg1 = 2 returns potential moderate fire type

The returned value is as follows:
1 = surface fire
2 = conditional surface fire
3 = passive crown fire
4 = active crown fire

Impact on users:
This does not affect output and is simply a new feature available to FFE users.
This function is currently available for use in FVS.  It will be included in the next
update of the Suppose interface.
