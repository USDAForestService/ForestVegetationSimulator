Subject: Inconsistent Setting of HT1 and HT2 Variables
Name: R. Havis
Date: October 19, 2011
Variants affected: NE and SN

Description: The HT1 and HT2 variables were assigned in BLOCK DATA, and also
             reassigned in SITSET based on location. This caused inconsistencies
             in serial runs. This was corrected.

Impact on users: Users of the NE and SN variants should obtain new executables.

Files:

./ne/src/blkdat.f
./ne/src/sitset.f
./sn/src/blkdat.f
./sn/src/sitset.f
