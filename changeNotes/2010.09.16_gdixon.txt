Subject: 1) SDI based mortality logic correction
         2) General code cleanup

Variants affected: 1) AK, AN, BM, CA, CR, CS_NEW, EC, LS_NEW, NC, NE_NEW, SN, SO, TT, UT, WS
                   2) CS, NE

Description: 1) An error in the logic when the entire tpa representation of the tree
                record gets assigned to mortality was corrected.
             2) Tab characters were eliminated from the code.

Impact on users: 1) This error would not affect most runs and would likely cause the 
                    projection to terminate abnormally.  However, users of these variants 
                    should obtain a new executable.
                 2) These changes will not affect projections.
