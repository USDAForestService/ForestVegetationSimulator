Subject: 1) Elimination of potential bug in SO ccf calculation
         2) Correction to cover extension routines for new 19 species version
            of the EM variant

Variants affected: 1) SO
                   2) EM

Description: 1) If the tpa representation for a tree record was zero, the ccf value
                was not being set correctly.
             2) An error in the cover extension was corrected for the new 19 species version
                of the Eastern Montana variant.

Impact on users: 1) A very slight effect on SO33 FFE calculations may be noticed.
                 2) Improved cover estimates for the 19 species version of the EM variant

Files:
so33/src   ccfcal.f  changed the date of revision; moved the skipping of the calculations
                     if the tpa representation for the tree record is zero to after the
                     initializtion of the ccf and crown width for that tree record to zero.

covr/src   cvcbms.f  changed the date of revision; changed the species mapping. 
                     modified some of the comment lines.
           cvshap.f  changed the date of revision; changed the species mapping.
