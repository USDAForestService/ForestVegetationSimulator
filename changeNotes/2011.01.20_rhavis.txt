Subject: Habitat Type
Name: R. Havis
Date: January 20, 2011
Variants affected: CI, EM, IE, KT, NI

Description: The internal habitat type sequence number was not set in the HABTYP
             routines of the affected variants. It was set external to the routines
             in the INITRE routine. This sequence number would not set correctly
             when FSveg PV codes are used to set habitat type. This has been corrected.

Impact on users: This change could affect habitat dependent calculations in the growth and
                 establishment.
