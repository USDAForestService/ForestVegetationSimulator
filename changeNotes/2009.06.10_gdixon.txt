Subject: Mature Stand Boundary (MSB) implementation in variants having SDI-based
         mortality models


Name: Gary Dixon
Date: 06/10/09

Variants affected: AK, AN, BM, CA, CR, CS_NEW, EC, EM, LS_NEW, NC, NE_NEW, SN, SO,
                   SO33, TT, UT, WS

Description: Users can simulate the deterioration of over-mature stands by changing
             the slope of the SDI relationship using the MORTMSB keyword. The MSB
             logic has now been revised, tested, and implemented in all variants 
             using an sdi-based mortality model.


Impact on users: None. This is a new feature and is only invoked when using the 
                 MORTMSB keyword which has not been announced to the public as yet.

common       VARCOM.F77   changed the date of revison; added a variable, EFFMSB, which is  
                          the mortality efficiency when invoking the MSB logic (default 0.9)

base/src     initre.f     changed the date of revision; added field 3 to the MORTMSB keyword
                          for users to set the mortality efficiency
             msbmrt.f     THIS IS A NEW ROUTINE to process MSB-related mortality                                

ppbase/src   getstd.f --| changed the date of revision; changed variable MXR from 122 to 123;
             putstd.f --| added variable EFFMSB

  bin        makefile     added new subroutine msbmrt to the link instruction for all variants
