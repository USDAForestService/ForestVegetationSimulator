Subject: Climate Model in Eastern Montana, and Western Sierra Variants
Name: R. Havis
Date: September 20, 2011
Variants affected: AK, BM, CA, CI, CR, EC, EM, IE, KT, NC, NI, PN, SO, TT, UT, WC, WS

Description:

1) The Climate extensions for the EM and WS variants were not updated when
   the variant species lists were expanded in May of 2011 (please see FVS Update
   Bulletin No. 715). This has been corrected.

2) Excessive tree heights were causing array storage overflow. This was corrected.
   These trees are assigned zero volume, and an error code equal to 4.

Impact on users: Users of the Eastern Montana, and Western Sierra climate extensions
                 should obtain new executables. Users of western variants should obtain
                 new executables.

Files:
./clim/em/obj - new directory
./clim/ws/obj - new directory
./clim/em/obj/makefile - new file with compile instructions for variant-specific climate objects
./clim/ws/obj/makefile - new file with compile instructions for variant-specific climate objects
./bin/makefile - added logic to compile and link variant-specific climate objects in
                 FVSemc, and FVSwsc, cleaned up compile instructions in FVSwsc build
./ak/src/varvol.f - changed commented write statements to debug write statements
./volume/src/profile.f - added check for number of log segments to prevent array overflow,
                         set volume to zero and return error code 4
