Subject:Root Disease damage code processing, RD for CR Model type 2
Name: Lance R. David
Date: 03/30/05
Variants affected: BM, CI, CR, EC, EM, IE, KT, NC, NC, NI, PN, SO,
                   TT, UT, WC, WS

Description: Parentheses were added to the conditional statements 
in the processing of the damage codes. The default order of 
evaluation resulted in (A or (B and C and D)) in stead of the 
correct evaluation order of ((A or B) and C and D). Infected trees 
had been interpreted as uninfected when the specific root disease 
damage codes (61, 62, 64) were used. The generic root disease damage 
code (60) was processed properly. This error was likely introduced 
in April 2004.

Root disease model made available when using Model type 2 in CR variant.

Impact on users: FVS simulations using the Root Disease model keyword
RRTREIN and having root disease damage codes 61, 62 and 64 with severity
codes 2 and 3 will see a higher initial infection level.
