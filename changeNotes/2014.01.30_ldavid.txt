Description: Dwarf Mistletoe Top 4 Species Summary Statistics Table had been
             failing write to database, only inventory output succeeded.
             This was due to the changes in our development environment and
             has been corrected. Also added code so that the blank records
             of the report when less than 4 infected species are present do
             not get written to the database.

Impact on users: No useless records in FVS_DM_Spp_Sum table.

Files:
dbs/src/dbsmis.f  - added code to skip blank records in DBSMIS1

mistoe/src/misprt.f - removed conditional that only loaded species for
                      first write of summary table.
