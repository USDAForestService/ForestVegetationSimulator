Variants affected: All WWPBM extensions

Description:
There are two types of changes.
(1) Ammended how "beetle model history" supplemental records (keyword
BMHIST) are read in.  Now, no decimal place is assumed.
(2) Output file changes: added cycle-beginning year to the "cycle"
output file (*.bmc); corrected the header for the detailed BKP output
file (*.bmb); increased reported precision of % BKP survival in detailed
BKP output file.  Fixed alignment of header in landscape average output 
file (*.bml).

Routine specific changes:

BMPPIN: Changed the format specification for the supplemental record READ 
   for the third field of keyword BMHIST (number of trees per acre being 
   initialized with BKP) to F10.0 (from F10.2).  Thus, now when user enters
   values without a decimal point, no decimal place will be assumed. 
BMOUT: corrected header in landscape average output file (*.bml)(moved "TPAH" one 
   space to the left.)  Added cycle-beginning year to the "cycle" output file (*.bmc).
   Accordingly, renamed the "YEAR" field; there are now 2 year fields, named 
   YR_B and YR_E (for "cycle-Beginning" and "cycle-End" years).  Swapped the 
   headers "TO_OW" and "FRMOW" (they were incorrectly placed) in the detailed 
   BKP output file (*.bmb).  Note: they were already correctly placed in the DB 
   output table.  The data field order in the standard output now matches that 
   in the DB output table.
   Changed reporting of BKP % survival (in the *.bmb) to 2 decimal places.
BMSETP: Added additional DEBUG output (reporting the BMHIST initialization data).
