Subject: Correction to Logic in CROWN Routines, added Numerical Error Trap to Volume Code
Name: R. Havis, Nick Crookston, YingFang Wang
Date: August 30, 2012
Variants affected: CA, CR, CS, LS, NC, and NE

Description:
1) The variable (ICRFST) was used to control processing in the CROWN
   routines but was not saved. The ICRFST variable was removed and the global
   variable LSTART was employed to achieve the same purpose.

2) Added logic to trap the condition where the number of logs in a tree exceeds
   the number of elements in the LOGLEN array. When the number of logs in a tree
   exceeds 20 segments, the volume of the tree is set to zero, and volume error
   code No. 12 is returned to the calling routine.

Impact on users: Users of Region 9 variants should obtain new executables.

Files:

./ca/src/crown.f - changed logic to use LSTART rather than ICRFST, and removed
                   unused variables from declarations statements
./cr/src/crown.f - changed logic to use LSTART rather than ICRFST
./nc/src/crown.f - changed logic to use LSTART rather than ICRFST
./volume/src/r9clark.f - added error flag variable in call to R9LOGS
./volume/src/r9logs.f - added error flag variable to subroutine and call statements,
                        added logic to trap potential array-out-of-bounds errors
