Subject: Rewrite of SDI-based mortality logic
Name: Gary Dixon
Date: 10/05/09
Variants affected: AK, AN, BM, CA, CR, EC, EM, NC, SN, SO, SO33, TT, UT, WS,
                   CS_NEW, LS_NEW, NE_NEW

Description: Coding for the SDI-based mortality logic was improved to speed
             up execution time, and correct other minor problems.

Impact on users: User's may notice slight differences in projection results.
