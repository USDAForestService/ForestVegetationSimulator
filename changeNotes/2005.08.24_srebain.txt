Subject: Database Extension options - new Structure Class table
Name:  Stephanie Rebain

Variants affected: All variants

Description:
The FVS Structural Statistics report was added to the Database Extension for easy export.
The new table name is FVS_StrClass.

To get this database table created, three keywords are needed - DSNOUT, the base FVS STRCLASS
keyword and a new Database Extension STRCLASS keyword.
 
DBS-STRCLASS keyword - if the structure statistics report has already been requested, and an
output database connection has been made, this keyword allows you to send the structure statistics
report directly to a database only, or to both the main output file and a database.

      field 1: 1 = both database and standard output are requested
               2 = database output only
               (default is 1)
 
Impact on users:
This change gives users additional output capabilities and does not change output.
The database extension documentation will also be updated for further information on
this new table.  A new version of Suppose is needed to access this keyword thru Suppose.
