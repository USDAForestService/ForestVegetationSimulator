***********************************************************************
C MISTOE $Id: miscnt.f 0000 2018-02-14 00:00:00Z gary.dixon24@gmail.com $
*----------------------------------------------------------------------
*  Purpose:
*     Counts the number of tree records with any mistletoe infection
*  greater than 0 and returns the values by species in array MSPCNT.
*  Note: MSPCNT species are ordered according to IREF, i.e. the order
*  of occurance of species in the treelist.
*----------------------------------------------------------------------
*
*  Call list definitions:
*     MSPCNT: (O) Array of number of DM infected records by species.
*
*  Local variable definitions:
*     DEBUG:  Logical flag to turn debug on or off.
*     I:      Loop counter.
*     ISPTR:  Pointer to current tree record's species number in
*                species ordered sort list.
*
*  Common block variables and parameters:
*     ICYC:   From CONTRL; cycle index number.
*     IMIST:  From MISCOM; array containing tree record DMR's.
*     IREF:   From CONTRL; index to order of occurance of species.
*     ISP:    From ARRAYS; species code number.
*     ITRN:   From CONTRL; current number of tree records.
*     JOSTND: From CONTRL; unit number of stand output.
*     MAXSP:  From PRGPRM; maximum number of species.
