C MISTOE $Id: misinf.f 0000 2018-02-14 00:00:00Z gary.dixon24@gmail.com $
*----------------------------------------------------------------------
*  Purpose:
*     This routine adds dwarf mistletoe infections to a proportion of
*  trees (by entire tree record) based on parameters input on the
*  MISTPINF keyword (species, proportion of trees, infection level and
*  randomness of dispersement). Trees that are already infected or
*  trees that are not susceptible to dwarf mistletoe will not be
*  changed by this process.
*----------------------------------------------------------------------
*
*  Call list definitions:
*     None.
*
*  Local variable definitions:
*     DEBUG:  Logical flag to turn debug on or off.
*     HTINDX: Temporary storage array for sorting by tree height.
*     I,J:    Loop counters.
*     IACTK:  Passed back from OPGET (unused).
*     IDATE:  Passed back from OPGET (unused).
*     IDMPTR: A pointer that cycles thru DM ratings from 1 to NEWLEV.
*     IDMR:   Same as IMIST.
*     INDX:   Current tree index number from TRINDX.
*     ISPC:   Species loop counter.
*     ITREE:  Tree record loop counter.
*     NEWCNT: Keeps count of TPA with new DM infections by species.
*     NEWFLG: Log. flag implies at least 1 species w/new DM infection.
*     NEWINF: Total TPA to have new forced DM infection by species.
*     NEWLEV: Level of infection to introduce (DMR 1-6) by species.
*     NEWPRP: Proportion of species to have new forced infection.
*     NEWTYP: Method of infection to introduce (0=random, 1=hi-lo,
*                2=lo-hi) by species.
*     NP:     Passed back from OPGET (unused).
*     NTODO:  Number of actions to perform in a cycle.
*     NUTYPE: Method of infection used in this cycle (from NEWTYP).
*     P:      Same as PROB.
*     PRM:    Array containing MISPINF keyword values.
*     SPTPAT: Array containing total # TPA by species.
*     TEMPTR: Temporary array used to reverse order of TRINDX.
*     TRINDX: Temporary index used to sort or randomize trees.
*
*  Common block variables and parameters:
*     HT:     From ARRAYS; individual tree record current height.
*     ICYC:   From CONTRL; cycle index number.
*     IMIST:  From MISCOM; individual tree record mistletoe rating.
*     IND1:   From ARRAYS; tree list access.
*     ISP:    From ARRAYS; current tree species.
*     ITRN:   From CONTRL; actual number of trees in stand.
*     IY:     From CONTRL; inventory year.
*     JOSTND: From CONTRL; unit number of stand output.
*     MAXSP:  From PRGPRM; maximum number species.
*     MAXTRE: From PRGPRM; maximum number tree records.
*     MISFIT: From MISCOM; which species affected by DM (see MISINT).
*     PROB:   From ARRAYS; trees per acre per tree record.
*
* Revision History:
*    02-AUG-99; Lance R. David (FHTET-FC)
*       Added definition and data statements for MYACTS array
*       and replaced the activity code literal in the CALL OPFIND
*       statements.
*       This change was provided by Bob Havis (FMSC) to eliminate
*       LF95 FORTRAN compiler warnings.
*    10-MAR-2008  Lance R. David (FHTET)
*       DMFLAG removed from argument list because it is now in common.
