C  Purpose:
C  BRIBA calculates the Rust Index based on Basal Area.
C
C  The functions used to determine the rust index from basal area were
C  provided by Geral McDonald, Intermountain Research Station, Moscow,
C  ID. Additional documentation can be found in Research Paper INT-258,
C  Computer Simulation of White Pine Blister Rust Epidemics, pp. 81-83.
C  Julie Williams-Cipriani provided assistance with the implementation
C  of these functions in the model code.
C
C  Rust Index is calculated once per cycle. The calculation is a three
C  step process.  Proportion Full Sunlight (PFS) is calculated first,
C  then Ribes Denity (RD) is calculated from PFS, and finally the
C  Rust Index (RI) is calculated.
C
C  BRIBA is called from BRSETP at initialization (cycle 0) and from
C  BRTREG each cycle depending on RI assignment method.

C.... Calculate Proportion Full Sunlight using the FVS current
C.... basal area (BA from common block PLOT);
C.... BA is stored in FVS as feet**2/acre --  the original calculation
C.... was based on meters**2/hectare.  The .00459 constant comes from
C.... dividing the original .02 by 4.36 which is the conversion factor
C.... from m2/ha to f2/ac.

      PFS=EXP(-(0.00459*BA))

C.... Calculate Ribes Density for all three Ribes species.
C.... The original functions are hectares; therefore, they are
C.... divided by 2.47 for conversion to acres.
C.... (bushes/hectare divided by acres/hectare = bushes/acre)

      RD(1)=(0.05+(2.15*(PFS**16.38)))/2.47

C....    If RIBPRP is 0 for any of the ribes species, don't do the
C....    calculation for that species (even when a 0 is entered for RDP
C....    you get a value anyway for BRI and it skews the rust index RI).
