C  Purpose:
C
C  This random number generator was modfied from the algorithm
C  found in the IMSL Library Vol. 1 Edition 4 to 5,
C  December 1, 1975, and can be found in the following references:

C
C  The code was written by N.L. Crookston, Forestry Sciences Lab,
C  October 1982, from the algorithm published in the IMSL manual and
C  tested by comparing the first 10000 draws from this version and
C  and the generator 'GGUBS' in the 1981 edition of IMSL.
