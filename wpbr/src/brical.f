C  Purpose:
C  BRIBA calculates the Rust Index based on exposure time.
C
C  The functions used to determine the rust index from exposure time were
C  provided by Geral McDonald, Intermountain Research Station, Moscow,
C  ID.
C
C  Rust Index (RI) is calculated once per cycle. The function has four
C  parameters and utilizes stand age as the exposure time variable.
C  The parameters are:
C     MINRI - minumum Rust Index
C     MAXRI - maximum Rust Index
C     PKAGE - stand age (exposure time) when Rust Index peaks
C     RISHP - defines shape of curve about the peak
C
C  Called from:
C     BRTREG depending on RI assignment method.
