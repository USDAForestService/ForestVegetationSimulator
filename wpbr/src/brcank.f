C  **BRCANK       DATE OF LAST REVISION:  06/05/2014
C----------------------------------------------------------------------
C  Purpose:
C   BRCANK reads the canker data provided in the keyword list or
C   canker data file.
C   This routine is called from the subroutine BRIN.

C     Added code to process comments marked with * or ! in
C     the canker data file. * = echoed. ! = skipped.
C  03-APR-2001 Lance R. David (FHTET)
C     Changed order of variables and added stock type to canker file
C     read.

C.... Read canker records. Note that all canker records will be read but
C.... a maximum of 10 cankers/tree will be tracked in the lethal canker

C.... the total canker count array for the tree but not loaded into the
C.... Blister Rust canker arrays.
C.... Tree's age is set to Prognosis stand age in subroutine BRSOR if
C.... tree age is not supplied on the canker record.

C.... Top of the canker record loop.
C.... If reading from an external file, read until the end of the file

C.... Comments may exist in the canker data file. Records with a "*" or "!"
C.... in column 1 are comments. Records with a "*" are written to FVS
C.... standard output file. Records with "!" are not, just skipped.
