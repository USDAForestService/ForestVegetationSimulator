C----------------------------------------------------------------------
C  Purpose:
C  This routine deletes cankers by moving them from the bottom of the
C  list to fill in empty canker record locations at the top of the list.
C  Vacant records were labelled in the calling routine by setting the
C  sign of those spots in the index negative.  The value of IVACT is
C  passed in as the number of negative members of the index.
C  This routine is called by BRCREM.
