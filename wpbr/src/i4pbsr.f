C  Purpose:
C  This is an INTEGER*4 keyed binary search.
C  Part of the Stand Prognisis Model (Forest Vegetation Simulator)
C  adapted from INTEGER search - NL Crookston - Jan. 1981 - Moscow, ID
C
C  Binary search routine:  finds the subscript location of F in
C  array A, if IORD is filled with the ascending order indices of
C  array A, rather than the descending order indices.  Array A need
C  not be in ascending order as long as the keys in IORD are in
C  ascending order over A.
C----------------------------------------------------------------------
C
C  Local variable definitions:
C    N    = the length of A.
C    A    = a list of INTEGER*4 values
C    IORD = an array of keys sorted in ascengin order over A.
C    F    = an INTEGER*4 value which you wish to find in A.
C    IP   = the position in A where F was found; or 0 when F is not
C           a member of A.
