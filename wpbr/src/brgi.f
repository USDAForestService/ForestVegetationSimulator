C  **BRGI         DATE OF LAST REVISION:  06/05/2014
C----------------------------------------------------------------------
C  Purpose:
C  BRGI calculates the growth index and sum target for individual white
C  pine trees (currently used for all species).
C  Minimum age of tree is set at 2 years for GI calculation.
C----------------------------------------------------------------------
C
C  IIAG - Tree age
C  HHT  - Tree height in meters
C  GIBR - Growth Index function result
C  TBSUM - Target area

C     description of change or update.
C  14-SEP-2000 Lance David (FHTET)
C     No changes actually made to this routine that calculates growth
C     index for white pine trees. The July, 2000 update to expand the
C     model to function on additional pine species did not address the
C     differences between species; therefore, it will likely be
C     necessary to develop species-specific sections and add species to
C     the argument list. FVS variant-specific versions of this may also
C     be necessary or desirable for future development.
C  28-FEB-2001 Lance R. David (FHTET)
C     Minimum tree age used in GI calculation set at 2 years.
C     Explicitly defined variables.
C  22-MAR-2001 Lance R. David (FHTET)
C     Added debug statment. Removed "0.0" preceding negative values in 
C     GI functions. Don't know why they were there in the first place,
C     but may have been needed for some earlier version compiler.
C  03-MAY-2001 Lance R. David (FHTET)
C     Disabled stand target area summing because it was already being
C     done in BRTREG and BRTARG.
C  07-NOV-2002 Lance R. David (FHTET)
C     Added max and min limits of 50 and 125 on growth index GIBR.
