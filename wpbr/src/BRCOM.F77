C....   BRS0 -- Used in the random number generator routine BRANN.
C....   BRS1 -- Used in the random number generator routine BRANN.
C....   BRSS -- Used in the random number generator routine BRANN.
C.... UPMARK -- Distance up from ground level in centimeters of highest
C....           canker in the tree. This is initialized in BRCANK when

C....           BRGI.
C....     RI -- Rust index for individual tree. Calculated in BRTARG
C....           and BRTREG.
C....   BRGD -- Tree ground diameter in centimeters. Calculated in
C....           BRSETP and updated in BRUPDT.
C.... BRHTBC -- Height to base of crown for the tree.  This value is
C....           initialized using the Prognosis crown ratio and is
C....           changed by pruning.
C....   BRPB -- Trees/acre dead due to blister rust. Calculated in
C....           BRCGRO.
C.... ESTCAN -- Estimated number of cankers expected in this year.

C....           Calculated in BRGI.
C....  ITCAN -- Total number of cankers for the individual tree. This
C....           number includes both potentially lethal and non-lethal
C....           cankers. This number can be larger than 10 for the tree.

C....           Actually this number is the cankers that will be tracked
C....           by the model (and therefore have the potential to become
C....           lethal - as opposed to the number stored in ITCAN which
C....           is used to determine spore production but which are
C....           never grown in the model). Maximum number of "lethal"
C....           cankers is 10. Calculated in BRCANK.  Modified in
C....           BRECAN and BRCDEL.

C...            blister rust hosts and represented by this model will
C...            have the appropriate index value in the host species
C...            position. See definition of BRSPC for list of BR host

C....  GIRDL -- Percentage of tree bole circumference which canker has
C....           girdled. Range: 0 to 100 percent.
C.... GIRMRT -- Canker girdling percent which causes death.  This value

C....           trees/acre (lethal only) by 2-inch DBH class.
C....           Calculated in BRSTAT.

C....           Calculated in BRTSTA.
C.... D2NOL  -- Real array to store total non-lethal TPA by 2-inch DBH
C....           class. Calculated in BRTSTA.

C....           class. Calculated in BRTSTA.
C.... D2EXC  -- Real array to store total excisable TPA by 2-inch DBH
C....           class. Calculated in BRTSTA.
C.... D2NOS  -- Real array to store total non-salvable TPA by 2-inch DBH
C....           class. Calculated in BRTSTA.

C.... D2WP   -- Real array to store total TPA that are white pine by
C....           2-inch DBH class. Should be the totals in each of the
C....           DBH classes of each of the statuses (D2CLN, D2NOL,

C....           BRTSTA.
C.... CKINIT -- Logical flag set with the CANKDATA keyword to signal
C....           that canker up, out, and girdle measurements will be
C....           randomly generated according to the canker counts read
C....           from the canker data (required last canker record for

C....           from initial tree conditions in BRTARG and used to
C....           adjust the default rust index. Default value is set to

C.... RISHP  -- defines shape of curve about the peak (in subroutine BRICAL)
