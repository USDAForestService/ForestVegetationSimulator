C  **BRCGRO       DATE OF LAST REVISION:  06/05/2014
C----------------------------------------------------------------------
C  Purpose:
C  BRCGRO grows cankers for one year and determines if any active
C  cankers will become inactive based on the specified inactivation
C  rate and a random number.  Cankers are also inactivated when:
C     - a branch or bole canker is located above the actual height
C       of the tree (current height or topkill height). If new cankers,
C       in addition to pre-existing cankers, are to be processed,
C       the actual height should be the height at end of cycle.
C     - a branch canker is located below the tree's base of crown,
C       because natural pruning can occur in Prognosis.
C
C  New cankers added during the current cycle are not processed
C  and this is accomplished with the parameter NLCAN.  If you want
C  to grow and inactivate newly added cankers, the common variable
C  ILCAN(K) could be used in place of NLCAN.
C
C  The processing order in BRCGRO is as follows:
C     - If canker is inactive, skip to next canker.
C     - Random number is drawn to determine if the current canker
C       will be inactivated.  If the canker is inactivated, set
C       status code and skip to next canker.
C     - Grow canker.
C     - Assign canker's status code.
C     - If canker status is topkill or tree kill, adjust tree
C       attributes: for tree kill - adjust BRPB(K), WK2(K);
C       for topkill - adjust UPMARK(K), ITRUNC(K), NORMHT(K), ICRED(K);
C       (If tree has more than one canker which has caused topkill,
C       the lowest one is used for the final calculation.)
C
C  Note: BRCGRO is not called if a tree is dead already.
C
C  Parameters passed:
C  ------------------
C     K      - (integer) holds value from IND1 array which identifies
C              the appropriate array index for the current "tree"
C     PROP   - (real) proportion of full cycle represented at current
C              year.  This is used because current year values are
C              calculated from values at start of cycle and adding
C              the appropriate proportion of the growths (height,
C              diameter). PROP values for yearly processing of a
C              5 year cycle would be: 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5, 5/5.
C     BRHT   - (real) tree height in meters at start of cycle.
C              If tree is top killed before or during the cycle,
C              this value is calculated based on the truncation
C              height in BRTREG.
C     BRHTG  - (real) tree height growth in meters for this year.
C              If tree is top killed before or during the cycle,
C              BRHTG is set to 0 in BRTREG.
C     BRDG   - (real) tree diameter growth in cm for cycle.
C     NLCAN  - (integer) number of lethal cankers for a single tree
C              before new cankers are added.
C     HNEW   - (real) tree height in feet for this year.  A proportion
C              of the height growth predicted by FVS has been added.
C              Top kill is not reflected.
C     DNEW   - (real) tree DBH in inches for this year.  A proportion
C              of the diameter growth predicted by FVS has been added.
C

C              centimeters. loaded from DOUT array.
C     PCTREM - percent crown remaining after topkill has occurred.
C     POTST  - this is the maximum distance out (in cm) that a canker
C              can be on a branch to avoid natural pruning when below
C              the base of the crown.
