C  **BRCREM       DATE OF LAST REVISION:  06/05/2014
C----------------------------------------------------------------------
C  Purpose:
C  BRCREM removes cankers that have been classified as inactive
C  or non-lethal.  Also removes excisable cankers when excising
C  is scheduled and prunable cankers when pruning is scheduled.
C  The tree's height to base of crown is reset for trees that
C  have been pruned.
C  Crown ratio carried by Prognosis is not changed.

C  Revision History:
C
C  dd-MMM-YYYY programmer_name
C     description of change or update.
C  24-MAY-1999 Lance David
C     Added debug code to track pruning.
C  14-SEP-2000 Lance David (FHTET)
C     Transfered Glen Brink's July, 2000 modifications from older version
C     of blister rust source code:
C     Modified to allow blister rust on other species using ISPBR array.
C     Species loop (label 200) and species temp index variable (I3)
C     are new.
C  05-MAR-2001 Lance David (FHTET)
C     Added pathological pruning control so that crown base height
C     will remain unchanged when a branch canker is pruned off.
C  09-MAY-2001 Lance R. David (FHTET)
C     Changed ISPBR to BRSPM.
C  09-MAY-2006 Lance R. David (FHTET)
C     Changed IND2 to ICNDX.
