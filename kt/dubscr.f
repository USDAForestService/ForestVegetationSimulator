C  THIS SUBROUTINE CALCULATES CROWN RATIOS FOR TREES INSERTED BY
C  THE REGENERATION ESTABLISHMENT MODEL.  IT ALSO DUBS CROWN RATIOS
C  FOR TREES IN THE INVENTORY THAT ARE MISSING CROWN RATIO
C  MEASUREMENTS AND ARE LESS THAN 3.0 INCHES DBH.  FINALLY, IT IS
C  USED TO REPLACE CROWN RATIO ESTIMATES FOR ALL TREES THAT
C  CROSS THE THRESHOLD BETWEEN THE SMALL AND LARGE TREE MODELS.

C----------
C  EXPECTED CROWN RATIO IS A FUNCTION OF SPECIES, DBH, HEIGHT, AND
C  BASAL AREA.  THE MODEL IS BASED ON THE LOGISTIC FUNCTION,
C  AND RETURNS A VALUE BETWEEN ZERO AND ONE.
C----------
      CR=BCR0(ISPC) + BCR1(ISPC)*D + BCR2(ISPC)*H + BCR3(ISPC)*BA
C----------
C  A RANDOM ERROR IS ASSIGNED TO THE CROWN RATIO PREDICTION
C  PRIOR TO THE LOGISTIC TRANSFORMATION.  LINEAR REGRESSION
C  WAS USED TO FIT THE MODEL AND THE ELEMENTS OF CRSD ARE THE
C  STANDARD ERRORS FOR THE LINEARIZED MODEL BY SPECIES.
