C  **BMBLKD WC--WESTWIDE PINE BEETLE MODEL  DATE OF LAST REVISION: 05/31/05
C           Westside Cascades (WC) FVS variant
C           Created 5/31/05.  AJM

***********************************************************************
* The following Westwide Pine Beetle Model variable initializations
* were originally within the subroutine BMINIT code.
* It was moved to this BLOCK DATA subprogram to satisfy the FORTRAN
* standards enforced by Lahey FORTRAN compiler.
* 08/16/94 Lance R. David
*
* Ammended 4/10/00.  Made host tree species and main pine beetle species
* undefined; that is, users must now explicitly define them.
*
* 5/31/05.  Snag falldown rates derived from information in the FFE addendum:
*(Reinhardt and Crookston 2005.  see note below AJM

C using data from table 4.17.3 FFE addendum (Reinhardt and Crookston, 2005)  
C Note: two sequence numbers are "blank", beware when comparing to table 4.17.3.
C If the falldown multipliers in FFE addendum were greater than 1, then herein
c the species is assigned a "medium" falldown rate.  Otherwise "slow".  
C The WWPB Model "fast" fall down rate is extremely fast (20% per year) relative
C to FFE's, so it wont be used.
