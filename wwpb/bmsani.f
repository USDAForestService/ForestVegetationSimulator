*             revised 7/28/05: added new var: REMBKP(ISTD)to bookkeep the BKP removed 
*             via sanitation cutting, by stand. In common.  For output.  AJM
*             REVISED 6/30/05.  TREE, BAH, and AREMS arrays should only be adjusted
*             when removing unattacked, low-RV trees.  COmmented out the adjustments 
*             happening to these arrays in the block where recently attacked trees
*             are being sanitized. AJM
*             Date of last revision 8/99(AJM).  Commented out block
*             referring to Target Volume removal method of calculating
*             amount to sanitize.  Target volume no longer a user-input
*             option.  The referred-to PRMS(6) does not exist.

C            Major revision to run Sanitize as stand level activity,
C            similar to SALVAGE keyword.  Also modified BMPPIN to
C            pass user specified stand list, from keyword file or
C            from user specified file, to BMSANI like SALVAGE keyword
*
*  Sanitation cuts are a landscape-level action. If conditions are right,
*  the cut could occur anywhere in the landscape. All beetle-killed trees
*  and low RV trees within the given size range will be removed.
*
*  NOTE THAT WE MAY WANT TO CHANGE THIS TO MAKE IT STAND-ACTIVATED (LIKE PHEROMONES)
C            Done May98 by RNH
*
*  Definitions:
*     IPC:    Loop counter over pool types (fast, med, slow)
*     ISIZ:   Loop counter over size classes
*     MINSC:  Minimum size class for cut
*     MAXSC:  Maximum size class for cut
*     RVMAX:  Maximum RV that will be removed (of unattacked trees)
*     REMOVE: Amount of TPA removed from one size class of recent kills
*     SUM:    Total amount of standing dead volume (all classes)
*     VREMOV: Amount of standing dead volume removed over size classes
