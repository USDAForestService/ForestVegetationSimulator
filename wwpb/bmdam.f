C  THIS ROUTINE PROCESSES THE MOUNTAIN PINE BEETLE DAMAGE CODES.
C  FOR THE WESTWIDE PINE BEETLE MODEL. THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT
C  ATTACKS ARE ON LODGEPOLE PINE ONLY (THIS IS NOT CHECKED) THAT
C  TREES MUST BE ALIVE, AND THAT THE ATTACK MUST HAVE HAPPENED 
C  WITHIN THE LAST (DEFAULT MODIFIABLE BY KEYWORD BMDAMAGE) TWO
C  YEARS PRIOR TO THE FIRST PPE MASTER CYCLE.

C  Revision History :
C  07/28/00 AJM:
C    Reading of damage codes changed so that damage codes 1, 2, 5 
C    are used and recognized instead of 3.
C  07/10/07 - Lance R. David (FHTET)
C    Time at which damage codes are processed is now at the end of 
C    keyword processing instead of during the reading of tree data.
C    So, tree data items that were passed as arguments are now 
C    available from the FVS common area. Original arguments were:
C    (II,IITH,ICODES)
C    FVS array IMC(II) is used as replacement for input tree history
C    code (IITH).
C    No need for special handling of dead tree index (IREC2) because
C    dead trees are already at the end of the arrays. Argument II is
C    correct index value for both live and dead.

C     PROCESS TREE RECORD. DEAD TREES ARE EXCLUDED, AND ONLY
C     BOLE ATTACKS (OR NOTHING RECORDED) ARE VALID. LOADING VALUES
C     INTO THE ARRAY WORKS BECAUSE *ALL* INVENTORIED STANDS ARE PART
C     OF THE DISPERSAL PROCESS. THEREFORE WHEN THE DISPERSAL STANDS
C     ARE RECORDED DURING THE READING OF THE INVENTORY, THERE WILL
C     BE A PROPER CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN 'ISTND', WHICH IS
C     INCREMENTED IN PPMAIN, AND IS USED TO ASSIGN THE STAND NUMBER
C     VIA A CALL TO GPADSD IN INSTND. THE LOGICAL FLAG IS USED IN
C     BM??? TO CONVERT A TREES/ACRE ATTACK FOR THE BMKILL ARRAY.
