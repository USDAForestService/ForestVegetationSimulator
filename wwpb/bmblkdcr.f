C  **BMBLKD CR--WESTWIDE PINE BEETLE MODEL  DATE OF LAST REVISION: 04/10/00
C           Central Rockies (CR) FVS variant
C---------- Modified 2/11/00 AJM...correcting variant-specific tree species
c          sequences, and setting appropriate defaults.
***********************************************************************
* The following Westwide Pine Beetle Model variable initializations
* were originally within the subroutine BMINIT code.
* It was moved to this BLOCK DATA subprogram to satisfy the FORTRAN
* standards enforced by Lahey FORTRAN compiler.
* 08/16/94 Lance R. David
*
* Modified host species data statements (HSPEC) and species fall-down
* rates (ISPFLL) to accomodate CR-model type 5 (lodgepole pine) species.
* This is a temporary fix -- we are only using model type 5 now.
* Matt Oberle 01/14/99 MJO
*
* Changed code so that there are NO default beetle host tree species.
* --ajm 3/15/00
