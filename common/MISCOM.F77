*-----------------------------------------------------------------------
*  Purpose:
*     Common block variables related to the dwarf mistletoe routines.
*-----------------------------------------------------------------------
*
*  Common block variables:
*     CSPARR: Array to hold 2 character representation of top 4
*                infected species; set in MISINT.
*     DGPDMR: Array containing diameter growth potential proportions
*                due to DM infection based on DMR; set in MISINT; set
*                from MISTGMOD keyword in MISDGF; saved for subsequent
*                cycles.
*     DMFLAG: Logical flag, true if mistletoe is present in the stand.
*     DMMMLT: Array containing DM mortality multipliers; set from
*                keyword in MISMRT, saved for subsequent cycles.
*     DMMTPA: Array containing TPA killed by mistletoe; set in MISMRT
*                for most variants, set in MISDIF for SW Mixed Conifer
*                and SW Ponderosa Pine variants.
*     DMRMIN: Minimum tree DBH for DMR/DMI statistics (this size or
*                larger to be counted); set from keyword in MISIN.
*     DMTALL: Array used to keep track of the tallest DMR-infected tree
*                by species, by plot; contains that tree's height, set
*                in MISTOE each cycle.
*     FSTMIS: Logical flag for printing mistletoe summary output table
*                headings; set first time through subroutine MISPRT.
*     FSTTBL: Logical flag for printing mistletoe detail table headings;
*                set first time printed in subroutine MISPRT.
*     HGPDMR: Array containing height growth potential proportions
*                due to DM infection based on DMR; set in MISINT; set
*                from MISTHMOD keyword in MISHGF. Set values remain in
*                effect until changed by a later scheduled MISTHMOD.
*     IMIST:  Array containing individual tree record dwarf mistletoe
*                (Hawksworth) ratings.
*     IMOUT1: Mistletoe output unit 1 (Top 4 species summary).
*     IMOUT2: Mistletoe output unit 2 (stand summary).
*     IMOUT3: Mistletoe output unit 3 (2" DBH class summary).
*     IMOUT4: Mistletoe output unit 4 (species/DBH class detail).
*     ISVSP4: Array of top 4 most DM infected species by number.
*     JRAN:   Status value of mistletoe random number generator.
*     LSORT4: Logical flag to set species by infection.
*     MISTBL: Logical array - what species desired in detailed output.
*     MISCYC: Logical array used for reading MISTGMOD keyword only once
*                per cycle (since MISDGF is called once per tree).
*     MISFIT: Array used to keep track of which species in the current
*                variant are mistletoe susceptible; variant specific;
*                (1=affected, 0=not affected by DM); set in MISINT.
*     MISFLG: Logical flag to turn mistletoe processing on/off; set from
*                keyword in MISIN, valid throughout a run.
*     PMCSP:  Array containing percent mortality equation coefficients
*                by species; set in MISINT.
*     PRFMST: Array containing species mistletoe removal preference
*                priorities; set from keyword in MISCPF.
*     PRTTBL: Logical flag to print DM detailed output tables.
*     PRTMIS: Logical flag to turn DM output table printing on/off; set
*                from keyword in MISIN.
*     SPPDMI: Array used to calculate DMI (ave DMR of infected trees only)
*                by species, by plot; set in MISTOE each cycle.
*     SPPTPA: Array used to accumulate trees per acre of infected trees
*                used in the calculation of point (plot) DMI.
*                by species, by plot; set in MISTOE each cycle.
*     USEMRT: Logical flag, true if using this model's mortality
*                calculations; set in MISIN0 or MISINT.
*     YNGMLT: Array containing DM spread probability(-) multipliers; set
*                from keyword in MISTOE, saved for subsequent cycles.
*     YPLMLT: Array containing DM spread probability(+) multipliers; set
*                from keyword in MISTOE, saved for subsequent cycles.
*
*  Revision History :
*     03/01/95 - Lance R. David (MAG)
*                Declaration of real variable array DMGMLT (size MAXSP)
*                removed from common area MISTL due to change of
*                MISTGMOD keyword.
*
*     04/10/97 - Julie C. Wil-Cip (FHTET)
*                Added array DMTALL to common area MISTL due
*                to modification of MISTOE subroutine to speed up the
*                spread of DMR from large to small trees on a plot.
*
*     06/15/97 - Lance R. David (FHTET)
*                Added arrays SPPDMI and SPPTPA to common area MISTL as
*                continued the modification Julie began to speed spread
*                and intensification on small trees when infected overstory
*                exists on the plot (aka point).
*  07-MAR-08; Lance R. David (FHTET)
*     Added variables that were local to misprt subroutine for output
*     control that need to be maintained for each stand in PPE 
*     processing mode.
*     Variables Added are: DMFLAG, PRTTBL, LSORT4, MISTBL and ISVSP4
*  21-APR-09; Lance R. David (FMSC)
*     Added variables IMOUT_ (thanks to Don Robinson)
*  30-SEP-10; Lance R. David (FMSC)
*     Added HGPDMR array for DM height growth impact proportions.
*  01-APR-11; Lance R. David (FMSC)
*     Added dimension to MISCYC array (1,x) used by MISDGF function
*     and (2,x) used by MISHGF (diameter and height growth impact).
