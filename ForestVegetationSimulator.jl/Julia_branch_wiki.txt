##ForestVegetationSimulator.jl

#Introduction

ForestVegetationSimulator.jl is a series of wrapper functions for the FVS API and other subroutines in the open-fvs project written in the Julia language (https://julialang.org/). 

#Build Process and Version Info

The functionality works with the .dll files produced by the standard MinGW build process outlined here(https://sourceforge.net/p/open-fvs/wiki/BuildProcess_MinGW/).

This branch was developed and tested on Windows 10 (64-bit) and Julia 0.6.2 using the compiler version: gcc (x86_64-posix-seh-rev1, Built by MinGW-W64 project) 7.2.0.

function name mangling was in the form of "functionname_"

#Technical Implementation

The functionality is achieved using just base Julia using the ccall function. Julia's use of the LLVM allows it to easily interact with both individual FORTRAN files and shared libraries. For more information see(https://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.6/manual/calling-c-and-fortran-code/)

#Installation

The project is designed to mimic the form used by most Julia packages which includes:
 - src folder which holds the function files 
 - docs folder which holds documentation
 - test which is where unit testing functionality would go
