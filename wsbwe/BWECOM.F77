C  --> VARIABLES FOR THE BUDWORM DAMAGE MODEL
C
C Revision History:
C   03-MAY-00 Lance David (FHTET)
C     Reduced size of array TABLE from 111 to 25, the actual number
C     of Defoliation Model keywords.
C   12-MAY-00  Lance David (FHTET)
C     Change variable ISIZE to TABSZ because ISIZE was used
C     elsewhere in the model for size classes. The was a problem for serial
C     processing of multiple stands, second set of budworm keywords failed.
C   16-AUG-01 Lance R. David (FHTET)
C     Added DSEEDD and DSEEDR variables for Damage model random number seed.
C   10-AUG-2006 Lance R. David (FHTET)
C     Reorganizing and removing obsolete variable in preparation for
C     linkage with PPE.
C   01-28-09 - Lance R. David (FMSC)
C      Common blocks added for character and double precision variables
C      that were in common BWECOM due to compiler complaint (mixed 
C      variable types in common) reported by Don Robinson (ESSA).
C   07/09/10 Lance R. David (FMSC)
c      Declared BWFINT for IMPLICIT NONE addition to subroutines.
