C     BLOCKDATA FOR THE  BUDWORM MODEL.
C
C     PART OF THE WESTERN SPRUCE BUDWORM MODEL.
C     FORESTRY SCIENCES LAB--MOSCOW, IDAHO--MAY, 1984
C
c   Major revision by K.Sheehan 7/23/96 to strip out
c     BW Pop.Dyn.Model stuff
c   Major revision by K.Sheehan 7/6/96 to add Defoliation Model stuff
c
C     DESCRIPTION :
C
C     MASSIVE INITIALIZATION OF BUDWORM VARIABLES AT LOAD TIME.
C     NON-EXECUTABLE CODE.
C     THE VARIABLES AND ARRAYS INITIALIZED HERE SHOULD BE STATIC AND
C     IF THE VALUES OF ANY OF THESE ARE CHANGED BY KEYWORD OR BY THE
C     MODEL DURING THE SIMULATION, THE INITIALIZATION OF THAT VARIABLE
C     OR ARRAY SHOULD BE MOVED TO SUBROUTINE BWEINT. OTHERWISE, RESIDUAL
C     VALUES OR PARAMETERS WILL BE PASSED TO THE FOLLOWING STAND WHEN
C     PROJECTING MULTIPLE STANDS IN A SINGLE EXECUTION.
C
C  Revision History:
C    01-MAY-00 Lance David (FHTET)
C       Changed keyword BUDLITE to GENDEFOL (General Defoliator).
C    03-MAY-00 Lance David (FHTET)
C       Corrected data statement for TABLE array size.
C       Changed value for MOPT to indicate FVS keyword file.
C    12-MAY-00 Lance David (FHTET)
C       Variable ISIZE changed to TABSZ.
C    31-MAY-00 Lance David (FHTET)
C       Removed data statements that had been commented out during
C       the process of moving initialization of nonstatic variables
C       to the BWEINT routine.
C    04-OCT-00 Lance David (FHTET)
C       Added data statemenst to load weather station names into
C       WSLOOK that had previously been loaded at runtime from 
C       stations.dat file.
C    10-NOV-00 Lance David (FHTET)
C       Put Western Larch back into host species list (IBWSPM). It
C       got left behind somewhere in the model update process.
C       Per Kathy Sheehan (10-JAN-01), inadequate data on budworm
C       impacts to Western Larch was available to the modeling team and
C       they chose to leave it as non-host for this reason.
C    09-SEP-06 Lance David (FHTET)
C       Moved non-static variables FOLDVY, FOLWTY and IOUT6A to bweint.f.
