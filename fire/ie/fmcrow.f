C     CALLS        RDPSRT
C                  PCTILE
C  PURPOSE:
C     THIS SUBROUTINE CALCULATES CROWNW(TREE,SIZE), THE WEIGHT OF
C     VARIOUS SIZES OF CROWN MATERIAL THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH TREE
C     RECORD IN THE CURRENT STAND.  THESE WEIGHTS DEPEND ON TREE
C     SPECIES, DIAMETER, HEIGHT, AND CROWN RATIO ACCORDING TO THE
C     RELATIONSHIPS DESCRIBED IN BROWN & JOHNSTON, 1976, 'DEBRIS
C     PREDICTION SYSTEM', FUEL SCIENCE RWU 2104, WHICH IS ITSELF
C     BASED PRIMARILY ON RES PAPER INT-197.
C
C     NOTE:  THE ALLOCATION BETWEEN CROWN SIZE CLASS 4 AND 5 IS
C            SOMEWHAT ARBITRARY, WITH CLASS 5 CURRENTLY NOT RECEIVING ANY.
C----------
C  LOCAL VARIABLE DEFINITIONS:
C     D:        DBH
C     H:        HEIGHT
C     HPCT:     HEIGHT PERCENTILE RANKING OF EACH TREE LIST ELEMENT
C     HPOINT:   HEIGHT POINTER: SPECIFIES WHICH TREE LIST ELEMENT HAS
C               THE TALLEST TREES, NEXT TALLEST, AND SO ON.
C     IC:       LENGTH OF LIVE CROWN
C     SPIE:     EQUAL TO ISPMAP
C     SPIW:     SPECIES NUMBER IS IE VARIANT
C     ISPMAP:   SPECIES (NUMBER) IN FMCROWW OR FMCROWE THAT DIFFERENT
C               SPECIES ARE MAPPED TO

C  YOU'LL NEED TO KNOW PERCENTILE HEIGHT OF EACH TREE.
C  TO GET THIS, MAKE AN ARRAY THAT LISTS THE TREE LIST ELEMENTS

C----------
      CALL RDPSRT(ITRN,HT,HPOINT,.TRUE.)
C----------
C  NOW CALL PCTILE TO GET THE HEIGHT PERCENTILE OF EACH RECORD.
C  NOTE THAT PCTILE ONLY WORKS IF YOU PASS IT THE DENSITY OF TREES IN
C  EACH RECORD RATHER THAN THE HEIGHT OF THE RECORD. NOTE ALSO THAT
C  ANY RECORDS WITH NO TREES WILL NONETHELESS COME BACK WITH THE
C  PERCENTILE RANKING IMPLIED BY THEIR HEIGHT. SUCH RECORDS WILL NOT
C  INFLUENCE THE PERCENTILE RANKING OF TREES IN OTHER RECORDS.
