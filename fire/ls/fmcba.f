C  SINGLE-STAND VERSION
C  CALLED FROM: FMMAIN
C
C  PURPOSE:  
C     FIND THE FOREST TYPE. SET THE INITIAL LIVE AND DEAD FUEL VALUES
C     THE DEAD FUELS ARE ONLY INITIALIZED IN THE FIRST YEAR, BUT THE 
C     LIVE FUELS MUST BE DONE EACH YEAR.  THE ROUTINE ALSO CALCULATES
C     PERCOV, WHICH IS NEEDED FOR THE FIRE BEHAVIOR CALCS.
C----------
C  LOCAL VARIABLE DEFINITIONS:
C     BAMOST:  THE HIGHEST BASAL AREA IN A SINGLE SPECIES
C     FUINI:   THE INITIAL DEAD FUEL LOADINGS 
C     FULIV:   THE HERB/SHRUB LOADINGS 
C     ISWTCH:  =1 if called by SVSTART
C              =0 if called by any other subroutine (FMMAIN, FMPPHV)
C     TOTBA:   THE TOTAL BASAL AREA IN THE STAND
