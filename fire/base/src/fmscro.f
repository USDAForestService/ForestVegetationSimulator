C     CALLED FROM: FMSADD
C
*  Purpose:
*     This subroutine divides the crowns of newly created snags into
*     pools that will become down debris at specified years in the
*     future.  The weight of crown material that each snag has in each
*     size class at the time of death is taken from CROWNW.  The time by
*     which all of the material of a given size will have fallen from
*     the dead snag is extrapolated from data in (**Al's reference to
*     the old Division of Forest Economics report (1961).  The model
*     assumes that a constant proportion of the material will fall in
*     each future year up to that time.
*----------------------------------------------------------------------
*
*  Local variable definitions:
*     ANNUAL:  amount of material in a size class that will come down
*              each year
*     DEADYR:  YEAR of Death of current snag (note:  during initializ-
*              ation, this may be more than one year before the next
*              year that will be simulated).
*     DSNAGS:  Density of SNAGS to use in calculating total weight of
*              crown components (depends on whether FMSCRO has been
*              called to deal with fire-killed snags or other snags).
*     DKCL:    decay class
*     ILIFE:   lifespan of the current class of crown material, as an
*              integer value 
*     ICALL:   Where was this called from? 1=after a fire,2=after a cut
*     FALLYR:  position in CWD2B array that corresponds to the year in
*              which a pool of material should fall.
*     RLIFE:   lifespan of the current class of crown material, as a
*              real value
*     SP:      snag species
*     TSOFT:   time for snag of this species and size to become soft
*     YNEXTY:  the number of years between the year of death and the
*              next year that will be simulated.
*     YRSCYC:  YeaRS left in current FVS CYCle (including current year)
