C     THIS ROUTINE IS THE 'MAIN' FIRE ROUTINE. IT LOOPS OVER
C     THE YEARS WITHIN A CYCLE, AND LOOPS OVER EACH STAND, EACH
C     YEAR. IT CALLS MANY OF THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE FIRE MODEL.
C     FMD IS DOMINANT FUEL MODEL.

C     Calculate the number of years in this cycle so that the decomposition
C     rates can be adjusted correctly for variable cycle lengths. 
C     This is necessary as we move from the FFE working on annual timesteps
C     to cycle timesteps. (note: this value is the same as IFINT)

C        Calculate the dominant cover type (as basal area)
C        Note that in the single stand case, this only needs to be
C        done once per cycle unless a burn has occurred during the cycle
C        (if the PPE version will read and write COVTYP and PERCOV then
C        that version will also need to only read it once too).
C         NOTE: cycle-boundary version will no longer need to check
C               version or year as this will be called every cycle.

C        This resets the value of cwdcut, which is based on salvage
C        removal, back to zero in all but the first year of a cycle.
C        This is necessary since the call to fmsalv was moved to fmsdit,
C        which is only called at the beginning of each cycle.  since
C        salvage cuts now only occur on cycle breaks, cwdcut should
C        always be zero in all other years.
C         NOTE: cycle-bouncary version no longer needs this, since
