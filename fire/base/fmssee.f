C PURPOSE:
C     SEES WHAT RANGE OF SNAG HEIGHTS WILL OCCUR IN EACH SPECIES+DBH
C     CLASS OF NEWLY CREATED SNAGS (HARVESTED OR KILLED MATERIAL), SO THAT
C     FMSADD WILL KNOW WHICH CLASSES NEED TO BE SPLIT INTO 2 HEIGHT CLASSES.
C     ALSO KEEPS TRACK OF TOTAL SNAG DENSITY EXPECTED IN EACH SPECIES+DBH
C     CLASS.
