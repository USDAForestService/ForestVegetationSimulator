C     SNAG DECAY PREDICTION
C
C   Purpose:
C     This routine calculates the number of years, since death, for a
C     snag to become soft, based on species, DBH, and plant association.
C
C     The base logic in this routine was extracted from its original
C     location in FMSNAG, FMSCRO, and SVSNAGE, in order to
C     structure/generalize the logic for use with both the
C     FFE snag pools, and the base FVS model snag records.
C
C   Called from: FMSNAG to compute decay time for a given FFE snag pool.
C                FMSCRO to compute decay time for a given FFE snag pool.
C                SVSNAGE to compute decay time for a given FVS snag record.
C
C   Local variable definitions:
C     D:       Diameter of current snag pool/record.
C     DKTIME:  Years, since death, for snag to become soft.
C     KSP:     Species number for current snag pool/record.

C----------
C  Call SVHABT to get habitat-based multiplier for decay rate.
C  (NOTE: SVHABT currently returns a constant value of 1.0.
C         The call to SVHABT is preserved here for potential future use.
C         The XMOD multiplier is not applied to decay rates computed in
C         the FMR6SDCY routine, since it specifically addresses plant
C         association.)
