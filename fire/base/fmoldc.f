C     CALLED FROM: FMMAIN
C
C  Purpose:
C     This subroutine records some crown size information for use in
C     calculating the amount of litterfall due to crown lifting in the
C     next cycle.  The proportion of total crown weight that will fall
C     in the next cycle is equal to ratio of the increase in the bottom
C     height of the crown to the total length of the crown (i.e., [new
C     bottom - old bottom] / old length).  The material to fall will be
C     added to down debris at a constant rate throughout the next FVS
C     cycle.  (In 'reality', some of this material would not fall until
C     later cycles, and some of the slow-falling material from earlier
C     cycles would fall during the current cycle.  The two effects 
C     partially cancel each other out, so simply falling all of the 
C     dead material derived from the current crown lift in the current
C     cycle is not grossly inaccurate).
