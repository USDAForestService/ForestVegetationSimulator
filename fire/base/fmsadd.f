C PURPOSE:
C     ADDS NEW SNAGS TO THE SNAG LIST, AVERAGING THE APPROPRIATE
C     SNAGS INTO ONE RECORD FOR EACH SPECIES-, DBH- AND HEIGHT-
C     CLASS.
C
c     **NOTE: THIS ROUTINE ASSUMES THAT MIN AND
C     MAX HEIGHTS FOR EACH CLASS HAVE ALREADY BEEN CALCULATED, AND THAT
C     IT WILL BE PASSED VARIABLES CONTAINING ALL NECCESSARY INFO.
C     **NOTE:  There is no information on cause-of-death at this time.

C     Local variable definitions:
C     DENJ:   total DENsity of snags in record J
C     DBHCUT: the dbh-class number of a snag class considered for disposal
C     GAPS:   indicates whether there might be some 'gaps' in the snag
C             list (i.e., previously used records that are now empty)
C     HTCUT:  the height-class number of a snag class considered for disposal
C     IGAP:   number of the last empty snag record found
C     ITYP:   Shows where the routine is called from.  This is so that during
C             initialization, the loop will go over the entire MAXTRE list.
C             <0=keyword,1=after a fire,2=after a cut,3=initialization,
C              4=nat mort
C     LOSSES: the total number of times that existing snags are overwritten
C             or new snags discarded during this subroutine call.
C     MIDHT:  half-way point between MAXHT and MINHT
C     MINDEN: the minimum density of snags found in any existing record
C     RECORD: the record number being used for each species- and dbh-class
C             of new snags
C     SPCUT:  the species number of a snag class considered for disposal
C     TAKEN:  indicates whether a snag record is already TAKEN by one of the
C             new snag classes (0 = not taken)
C     UNFIRE: the density of snags in the current record that were NOT killed
C             by fire
C     YEAR:   the year of death of all the snags to be added during this
C             subroutine call (during initialization, this may be more than
C             one year before the next year that will be simulated).
