*     SINGLE-STAND VERSION
*     CALLED FROM: FMBURN
*  PURPOSE:
*     THIS SUBROUTINE RETURNS TWO TYPES OF INFORMATION: THE FUEL MODEL
*     THAT WOULD BE USED IF THE STATIC FUEL MODEL OPTION IS SELECTED
*     (STORED AS IFMD(1), WITH A WEIGTH OF FWT(1)=1.0 AND THE CLOSEST
*     FUEL MODELS (UP TO 4) AND THEIR WEIGHTINGS FOR USE BY THE DYNAMIC
*     FUEL MODEL
*----------------------------------------------------------------------
*
*  CALL LIST DEFINITIONS:
*     FMD:     FUEL MODEL NUMBER
*
*  COMMON BLOCK VARIABLES AND PARAMETERS:
*     SMALL:   SMALL FUELS FROM DYNAMIC FUEL MODEL
*     LARGE:   LARGE FUELS FROM DYNAMIC FUEL MODEL
