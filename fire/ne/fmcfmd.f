C  SINGLE-STAND VERSION
C  CALLED FROM: FMBURN
C  PURPOSE:
C     THIS SUBROUTINE RETURNS TWO TYPES OF INFORMATION: THE FUEL MODEL
C     THAT WOULD BE USED IF THE STATIC FUEL MODEL OPTION IS SELECTED
C     (STORED AS IFMD(1), WITH A WEIGTH OF FWT(1)=1.0 AND THE CLOSEST
C     FUEL MODELS (UP TO 4) AND THEIR WEIGHTINGS FOR USE BY THE DYNAMIC 
C     FUEL MODEL OPTION
C----------
C  CALL LIST DEFINITIONS:
C     FMD:     FUEL MODEL NUMBER
C
C  COMMON BLOCK VARIABLES AND PARAMETERS:
C     SMALL:   SMALL FUELS FROM DYNAMIC FUEL MODEL
C     LARGE:   LARGE FUELS FROM DYNAMIC FUEL MODEL

C  VERTICAL LINES. IF ANY OF THE LINES DEFINED BY XPTS() ARE OF
C  AN UNUSUAL VARIETY, THIS MUST BE ENTERED HERE SO THAT
C  SPECIAL LOGIC CAN BE INVOKED.  IN THIS CASE, ALL THE LINE

C  COLUMN CONTAINS THE LARGE FUEL VALUE FOR EACH FIRE MODEL WHEN
C  SMALL FUEL=0 (I.E. THE Y-INTERCEPT OF THE LINE).
