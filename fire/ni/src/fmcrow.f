C     CALLS        RDPSRT
C                  PCTILE
*  Purpose:
*     This subroutine calculates CROWNW(tree,size), the weight of
*     various sizes of crown material that is associated with each tree
*     record in the current stand.  These weights depend on tree
*     species, diameter, height, and crown ratio according to the
*     relationships described in Brown & Johnston, 1976, 'Debris
*     Prediction System', Fuel Science RWU 2104, which is itself
*     based primarily on Res Paper INT-197.
*
*     NOTE:  The allocation between crown size class 4 and 5 is
*            somewhat arbitrary, with class 5 currently not receiving any.
*------------------------------------------------------------------------
*
*  Local variable definitions:
*
*     D;        Dbh
*     H:        Height
*     HPCT:     Height PerCenTile ranking of each tree list element
*     HPOINT:   Height POINTer: specifies which tree list element has
*               the tallest trees, next tallest, and so on.
*     IC:       length of live Crown
*     SP:       SPecies
*
*  Common block variables and parameters:
