C     SINGLE-STAND VERSION
C     CALLED FROM: FMMAIN

C  PURPOSE:
C     FIND THE DOMINANT SPECIES (BY BASAL AREA). SET THE INITIAL LIVE
C     AND DEAD FUEL VALUES AS WELL. THE DEAD FUELS ARE ONLY INITIALIZED
C     IN THE FIRST YEAR, BUT COVTYP AND THE LIVE FUELS MUST BE DONE
C     EACH YEAR.
C----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  LOCAL VARIABLE DEFINITIONS:
C     BAMOST:  THE HIGHEST BASAL AREA IN A SINGLE SPECIES
C     COVINI:  THE SERAL COVER TYPE TO BE USED FOR INITIATING FUELS IN
C              BARE STANDS. THE DIMENSION (92) MATCHES THE DIMENSION OF THE
C              PLANT ASSOCIATION TABLE IN **HABTYP**
C     TOTBA:   THE TOTAL BASAL AREA IN THE STAND (USED IN THE FUELS CALCS)
C     OLDCOV:  THE COVER TYPE FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR (USED IN YEARS WITH NO BA)
C     ILOGMOD: THE 'PREVIOUS LOGGING' MODEL
C     ISSX:    THE OTTMAN STRUCTURAL STAGE INDEX
C     ISWTCH:  =1 if called by SVSTART
C              =0 if called by any other subroutine (FMMAIN, FMPPHV)
C     ISPX:    THE INDEX OF THE DOMINANT BASAL AREA SPECIES; AND THE INDEX
C              TO THE COVER TYPE * STRUCTURAL STAGE DATA STRUCTURE COVRINI
C  FUELINI CONTAINS INITIAL FUELS DATA FOR SHRUBS, HERBS, AND THE
C  EIGHT FUEL TYPES (SEE *TYPE FUEL_STR* ABOVE FOR DETAILS), INDEXED
C  BY THE FCC VEGETATION INDEX. THE 43 OBJECTS OF FUELINI REPRESENT ALL

C----------
C  COVRINI CONTAINS THE APPROPRIATE FCC MODEL (FROM OTTMAN), GIVEN THE
C  LEADING COVER TYPE (COVINDX) AND STRUCTURAL STAGE (STRINDX).
C  COVER TYPE AND STRUCTURAL STAGE ARE COMBINED IN THE FIRST ELEMENT OF
C  THE STRUCTURE BY MULTIPLYING COVER TYPE * 10, THEN ADDING THE STRUCTURAL
C  TYPE. SO 53 IS COVER TYPE 5 (MOUNTAIN HEMLOCK) WITH STRUCTURAL STAGE 3
C  (STEM EXCLUSION CLOSED CANOPY). THE STRUCTURAL STAGES DO NOT ALL
C  CORRESPOND TO THE FVS DEFINITIONS. IN PARTICULAR, THERE IS NO BAREGROUND
C  STAGE, AND THE STEM EXCLUSION STAGE IS DIVIDED INTO 2 FORMS, OPEN AND
C  CLOSED CANOPY. THESE DIFFERENCES ARE HANDLED IN THE CODE. LASTLY, THE
C  COVRINI VECTOR MAPS THE LOGGING HISTORY. THERE ARE 5 KINDS OF
C  LOGGING HISTORY. GENERALLY ONLY THE FIRST IS USED. THE REST ARE INCLUDED
C  BECAUSE THEY MAY BE UNDER USER CONTROL IN THE FUTURE. THEY ARE:
