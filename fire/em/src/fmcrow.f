C  **FMCROW  FIRE-EM DATE OF LAST REVISION:  01/10/12
C----------
C     CALLED FROM: FMSDIT, FMPRUN
C     CALLS        RDPSRT
C                  PCTILE
C  Purpose:
C     This subroutine calculates CROWNW(tree,size), the weight of
C     various sizes of crown material that is associated with each tree
C     record in the current stand.  These weights depend on tree
C     species, diameter, height, and crown ratio according to the
C     relationships described in Brown & Johnston, 1976, 'Debris
C     Prediction System', Fuel Science RWU 2104, which is itself
C     based primarily on Res Paper INT-197.
C
C     NOTE:  The allocation between crown size class 4 and 5 is
C            somewhat arbitrary, with class 5 currently not receiving any.

C  Local variable definitions:
C
C     D;        Dbh
C     H:        Height
C     HPCT:     Height PerCenTile ranking of each tree list element
C     HPOINT:   Height POINTer: specifies which tree list element has
C               the tallest trees, next tallest, and so on.
C     IC:       length of live Crown
C     SP:       SPecies
