C REVISION HISTORY:
C     May-June, 2000 Glenn E. Brink
C       Added variables IDXWP,IDXWL,IDXDF,IDXLP and IDXPP, array indices of
C       White Pine, Western Larch, Douglas Fir, Lodgepole Pine and
C       Ponderosa Pine respectively.  Added to common block in file
C       MPBCOM.F77.
C       Added array MPBSPM to govern the computations in surfce.f by
C       species using an IF block as opposed to the old COMPUTED GO TO,
C       since the array allows the definition to be made in mpblkd.f,
C       instead of always having to change the COMPUTED GO TO.
C   	Added to common block in file MPBCOM.F77.
C   07/02/10 Lance R. David (FMSC)
C     Added IMPLICIT NONE.
C   08/22/14 Lance R. David (FMSC)
C     Function name was used as variable name.
C     changed variable INT to INCRS
